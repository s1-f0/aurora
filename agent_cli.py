agent_cli.py -- THE single door an external agent (e.g. OpenCode) uses.

OpenCode is a separate process; it cannot import our Python. So it SHELLS OUT here.
Everything an agent needs is two commands:

    py agent_cli.py boot  <agent_id> [--task "..."] [--json]
        Print this agent's startup context: the ranked lessons + project state that
        matter for the task, distilled to a token budget. Read this FIRST.

    py agent_cli.py learn <agent_id> --experiment NAME --tried "..." --result "..."
                       [--expected "..."] [--recommend "..."] [--category C]
                       [--success yes|partial|no] [--confidence low|medium|high]
        Record a lesson back into shared memory so the next agent benefits.

Helpers:
    py agent_cli.py recall "<query>" [--json]   Search past lessons.
    py agent_cli.py status [--json]             Honest system status.

Design notes:
  * Front-loaded: the most useful output is in the FIRST lines (a 50-line reader
    still gets the gist).
  * Fail-soft: Redis down -> File fallback. Never crashes on a missing backend.
  * ASCII-only AUTHORED output; stdout/stderr are forced to UTF-8 (errors=replace) so
    STORED text from peers (em-dashes etc.) survives Windows pipes without mojibake.
  * Robust at the seam: partial / empty / None / huge inputs are sanitized, not fatal.

    `_intake` is right for context/focus/task: a clipped context still helps, and its
    spill-to-file plus confession closes the RB-5 silent-corruption class properly. A handoff
    note is different on two counts, and both were paid for tonight.

    (a) A BRIEFING THAT ENDS MID-SENTENCE IS WORSE THAN A SHORT ONE, because the reader cannot
        tell what was lost or judge whether to go looking for it.
    (b) THE RECOVERY PATH WAS INVISIBLE TO THE ONE READER IT EXISTS FOR. `_intake` spills to
        state/spill/<file>.txt and `boot` never reads state/spill/. The full text survived on
        disk in the single place the next seat would not look.

    So on overflow the full body goes to a durable NOTE -- project-scoped, not per-agent
    (`note <anyone> --get <title>` resolves it), which is exactly what boot-adjacent readers
    already use -- and the stored field LEADS with the pointer so it survives any further
    truncation downstream and is the first thing read rather than the last.

    WHY THIS IS NOT A WRITING DISCIPLINE. The lesson
    `a_cap_you_know_about_still_needs_the_body_written_to_fit` records two prior sessions lost
    to this and prescribes "write the body to the cap FIRST". It fired at its own author
    tonight, by accident, on an unrelated call, AFTER two overruns -- and a third attempt was
    still needed to fit. A rule that must be recalled at compose time will not be.

    2026-07-25, the reason this exists. Three of the four continuity organs were carrying
    stale content AT THE SAME TIME -- GROUND FIRST aimed at a two-day-old chronicle,
    where-we-are trailing four commits, and the directive naming a plan a debate had
    superseded. Nothing said so. The seat found out by looking.

    That is the asymmetry this closes: RETRIEVAL is automatic (recall-at fires at every
    action, unasked, and it is the organ that demonstrably works) while CAPTURE is manual
    (wrap, note, --grounding all wait for a seat to remember at the right moment). A
    continuity layer whose refresh depends on remembering is a continuity layer that goes
    stale exactly when a session was too busy to remember -- which is when it matters most.

    This does NOT auto-write anything. Deliberately. The corpus already grows at ~13.7x its
    own target rate with flat measured value, so generating content automatically would add
    noise to a system whose problem is not scarcity. Tonight's failures were never MISSING
    content; they were stale POINTERS to content that already existed. So the automation
    belongs on the pointer, not the payload: notice the drift, say it, and let a seat decide
    whether it matters. Silent when the notes are newer than HEAD -- no drift, no line.

    a seat inherits the FORMS (open with intent, quote Daniel) without the LICENSE (the
    laws are a floor it is permitted to amend) -- "the difference between a culture and a
    compliance checklist." That is why line 2 is the license and not more law text.

    Stamped with conduct_version per the v1.1 substrate rule. Kimi F2 found ZERO existing
    projections carry that stamp; this organ is born compliant instead of joining the gap.

    T244 taught ask_many that a branch may declare the evidence its standpoint allows. This
    door then did `[str(p) for p in loaded]` and stringified every element, so the capability
    was unreachable AND the failure was silent: the dict became its own Python repr and was
    sent as the question, so a helper received {'prompt': 'audit this', 'files': [...]} and
    answered it. Built, wired, and destroyed in transit -- the check_wiring class in the shape
    that is hardest to see.

    REFUSES a `prompt`-less object BY INDEX rather than yielding an empty branch. A paid-for
    helper that was asked nothing returns nothing, and in a fan of twenty that is
    indistinguishable from a helper that found nothing -- the same silent-cap lie this repo
    keeps paying for.

    Extracted to module level because it could not be pinned inline, which is the other half
    of why the defect shipped.
