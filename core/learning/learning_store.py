Learning Store: Persists and retrieves experiment outcomes via the Store.

Semantic Relationship: Learnings persist_to Store (Redis when up, Files always)

Captures and organizes experiment outcomes to prevent rework and enable
collective learning. Learnings derive from experiments and are indexed for
discovery by other agents.

PERSISTENCE MODEL (Pillar 0)
----------------------------
This module talks ONLY to a `Store` (core.foundation.store). The Store handles
Redis-vs-file selection and graceful degradation, so this module no longer
branches on "if redis else file" -- there is exactly one code path per
operation. Swapping persistence = swapping the injected Store.

Learnings are indexed with the same structure regardless of backend:
- learn:experiment:{id}      (hash)  full experiment record
- learn:experiments:all      (list)  experiment ids, newest first
- learn:experiments:success  (zset)  id -> success score (0/50/100)
- learn:category:{category}  (set)   experiment ids in a category
- learn:agent:{agent_id}     (list)  experiment ids from an agent
- learn:anti_patterns        (set)   known anti-pattern names
- learn:anti_pattern:{name}  (hash)  anti-pattern detail

Usage:

    persist_learning_to_store({
        "experiment_name": "exp_1", "what_tried": "approach_x",

# ---- RETRIEVAL VOCABULARY ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# The flood, measured 2026-08-02: asking the corpus a shader question returned 77, 707 and 675 rows,
# every one of them about bus lanes and ACLs, and it never said "I have nothing". The cause was two
# lines below the surface -- `hits = sum(1 for t in terms if t in haystack)` then `if hits:`. That
# is a SUBSTRING test with no floor, so "the" matched almost every record and "state" matched
# "statement". A ten-word question therefore reached most of the corpus and came back RANKED, which
# reads as confidence.
#
# The same defect turned up twice more the same day in unrelated instruments (a PNG decoder that
# returned ten identical confident errors; a metric suite that scored three visibly different images
# as identical). AN INSTRUMENT THAT CANNOT SEE ITS SUBJECT RETURNS A CONFIDENT ANSWER, NOT SILENCE.
# Recall is allowed to answer "nothing" -- and must, or every other honesty guarantee is decoration.
