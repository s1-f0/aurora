"""T323 s1 -- the route record: the string through the forest, as a thing you can hold.

Daniil's charter, verbatim (eye ed728d23:2173): "a string through a forest you can walk with
by hand so you dont need to re-discover relationships between different things... a mechanical
through line for work we did and become an easy to parse and easy to trace map." And the
policy sentence this module enforces at every broken leg (adopted by the fence as literal
mechanics): "A unclear route is still a route, and we can update them as we go."

Lineage, exact: his idea -> the twin's synthesis (ed728d23:2461, a route IS a chain of
reified provenance) -> the fan-5 record schema (atom .._troubleshooting-re-fan_3ddf5a) ->
deepseek's physics pass (atom .._t323-fence-deepseek_9f8fb4) -> this build.

THE SUBSTRATE SPLIT (the one amendment to the fence counter, made loudly): deepseek said
"put routes in the Eye's own SQLite" -- right spirit (routes are provenance over addresses;
they belong beside the addresses), one flaw: eye.db is gitignored and rebuildable-by-design,
and a route is an AUTHORED object. A rebuild would erase every string anyone ever tied. So
Pillar 0's own split applies:

    state/coord/routes.jsonl   append-only, TRACKED  -- the authored truth (the Ledger half)
    eye.db routes/route_steps  queryable projection  -- rebuildable from the journal (Store)

Saves append the journal first, then upsert the projection. rebuild() replays the journal,
so wiping the projection loses nothing authored (pin P5). deepseek's idempotency survives at
both layers: the route id is a content hash, so a crash-redelivered or double-pasted save is
the SAME line and the SAME row (pin P2), and the projection insert is INSERT OR IGNORE.

T335 -- WALKS ARE RECORDS TOO, and until 2026-08-17 they were the exception to the sentence
above. A walk only incremented walk_count in the PROJECTION; rebuild() replayed nothing but
route_saved, and _project() inserts walk_count=0. So "wiping the projection loses nothing
authored" was true of every field except the one this organ produces by being USED -- the
route survived a wipe and the evidence anyone had walked it did not. Walks now journal as
kind="route_walked" and replay like saves, so the law holds as written.

The same record closes the ambiguity Daniil named ("I don't want our forest thread to lie to
us"): walk_count could not tell a glance from a traversal. Each walk now carries a DEPTH
derived from the executed path -- listed / resolved / drilled, with legs_drilled counting
BODIES OBTAINED rather than legs attempted. Walks taken before this existed resolve UNKNOWN
in walks(); they are never backfilled, because inventing a depth for them would be the exact
defect the field was added to remove.

STEP VOCABULARY (fan-5, trimmed to s1): observation | discriminating-test | decision |
dead-end | anchor | handoff. Dead ends are first-class and carry the refuted hypothesis in
`is_not` plus the receipt that killed it -- half a route's value is the pruned branch the
next walker skips. Unknown types are refused at save: a vocabulary that accepts anything
means nothing (the kind-resolution lesson, one plane over).

s1 deliberately does NOT include: the recall-at trigger join (s2, holds for kimi's
precision counter), assertions/competing-route ranking (s3), retraction (s4), prefetch (s5).
