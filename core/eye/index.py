"""THE EYE S0 -- the incremental transcript indexer, coverage contract built in.

Laws this module carries (from the fenced design + the night's lessons):

  - operator speech lives in `user` turns AND `queue-operation` records
    (operator_speech_hides_in_queue_operation_records) -- both ingest, always.
  - VOICE is conservative: operator | agent | system. Command-caveats, system-reminders,
    task-notifications and isMeta records inside `user` rows are SYSTEM -- the
    false-positive class the success-vocabulary sweep paid for.
  - every event is ADDRESSABLE: event_id = "<session>:<line>", resolving to the verbatim
    record. The grammar's address space; T288's citation-resolver substrate.
  - THE COVERAGE CONTRACT: the report names every file it could not read and refuses to
    claim wholeness past a gap (manifest_complete). A clipped index that reads as whole is
    the laundering class this organ was born from.
  - incremental by (mtime, line-cursor): transcripts are append-only; a re-run ingests
    only appended lines.

The index is a projection: state/eye/eye.db (WAL), rebuildable, never committed.

         20 of them no longer anywhere else). Ninety sessions were unreachable. Both sides now

         them. They are INDEXED, not excluded, because the index already carries a `voice` field
