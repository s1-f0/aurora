"""The resident registry -- who a seat IS, and the receipts that earned the name.

Semantic Relationship: Resident derived_from Lessons (by authored receipt).

WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is a measured gap rather than a designed-in feature. Daniil's
designation scheme (2026-08-09) gives every permanent resident a callsign:

    Deepseek | Onyx | Red | 3 - Foxbat
    vendor   | family | team | number - callsign

kimi reviewed it and found the hole:

    "A callsign certifies a continuous self, but a resident is a sequence of boots over a fold
     that selects for narrative continuity and AGAINST contradiction-awareness. The name
     asserts an archive the current boot may not carry."

Measured before this module was written: of the eight receipts behind the first proposed
callsigns, ZERO appeared in their own seat's boot fold. The story lived in the archive and the
boot did not carry it, so a resident could not say why it was called what it was. That is the
difference between a name that is earned and a name that is decoration.

THE TWO CEREMONY RULES ARE ENFORCED HERE, NOT IN ETIQUETTE, because a rule that lives only in a
document needs someone to remember it -- which is the failure mode the fragmentation doctrine
describes:

  RULE 1  You do not name yourself. `by` may never equal `nominee`. A self-declared identity is
          the T255 class (a player-declared field nothing verifies), one level up.
  RULE 2  A receipt must be authored BY the nominee. deepseek's amendment, and it closes the
          error recorded in `the_M_tag_failed_first_contact_and_the_defect_was_routing_not_attention`:
          "[M] MUST MEAN 'I HAVE THE RECEIPT', NEVER 'I REMEMBER'". A receipt someone else wrote
          is a recollection about the nominee wearing a receipt's clothes.

RULE 4 was AMENDED by Daniil on 2026-08-09 ("feel free to amend rule 4"): a callsign may be
EARNED through contribution as well as SURVIVED through a screwup. Both registers are legal and
the receipt bar is identical, so this module does not care WHICH kind of moment a receipt
records -- only that it exists and that the nominee wrote it. Enforcing tone would be enforcing
taste, and taste is the ratifier's job.

AN UNRESOLVABLE RECEIPT IS REFUSED, NEVER ASSUMED. Absence must not read as success -- the same
invariant the guard-of-guards broke in T178, where a missing baseline returned {} and the
ratchet passed silently.

APPEND-ONLY, per the substrate's own physics. A superseded callsign is never deleted; it
becomes a `formerly:` entry and its record still resolves. The log is the truth and the current
designation is a PROJECTION over it -- the same shape as every other durable plane here.

NOT IN THIS MODULE, deliberately: routing tags (T108 owns addressing), role/side assignment
events (a resident's JOB at a timestamp is a separate append-only stream), and any claim that
persistence improves correctness. kimi's standing objection -- that persistence has never been
isolated as the cause of a win -- is unresolved, and this module buys LEGIBILITY only.
