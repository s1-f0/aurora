Packet Spec v1 -- envelope integrity + MTU library (T040 LAW; built in T043).

Cites docs/library/design/20260701_packet-spec-v1-reconciled-build-spec-dua_a50b94.md (Status: LAW). This module is the SINGLE SOURCE OF
TRUTH for the parts of the packet contract that are pure computation -- the MTU bound, the
len+sha integrity pair over a canonical serialization, and (below) fragmentation/reassembly
of oversize payloads. It has NO Redis / IO dependency, so both doors compute identically:
the SEND door (bus._emit) stamps, the CONSUME door (bus._drain) verifies, and the answer
filter (expectations._answers_since) reuses the SAME verify so a corrupt reply is invisible
to every consume path (RB-29 extension, pin 9). Pure functions => the 10 acceptance pins
test computation, not transport.

Why a separate module (spec R6): "schemas live in core/comm/packet_spec.py (code is the
source of truth; families are contracts, not tunables)". bus.py orchestrates; this computes.

CANONICAL INTEGRITY FIELDS. The seven v1 wire fields (frm, to, kind, content, ts, meta,
parts) -- exactly as they already sit in the Redis stream, i.e. the literal STRING values
(content/meta/parts are json.dumps'd at the send door) -- are hashed in canonical form.
Hashing the literal stream strings (NOT re-parsed objects) guarantees the consume door,
which reads those exact bytes back from Redis, computes a byte-identical digest; a
re-parse->re-serialize round-trip would risk dict-order / float-repr drift. Envelope-control
fields (v, len, sha, frag, lane, family, pri, deadline_ts, seq, ecn, idempotency_key) are
deliberately NOT hashed: they are transport metadata with their own validators, not message
content -- and you cannot hash the hash.

DIALS are read at CALL time (not import time), matching the codebase's per-call config
pattern, so a flip is honored live without reimport:
  BUS_MAX_MESSAGE_BYTES   (default 65536) -- MTU; a packet whose canonical len exceeds it is
                          REFUSED loud at send (never truncated), or fragmented if opted in.
  PACKET_INTEGRITY_ENABLED(default True)  -- kill-switch; False degrades to v1 integrity, LOUD.
  FRAG_REASSEMBLY_TTL     (default 300s)  -- a whole whose fragments do not all arrive within
                          this window is dropped LOUD with the missing seq(s) named.

# The registry (core/comm/kinds.py) reported this set as one third of a forked concept `ask`,
# but the fork was false: the producer census found exactly one emitter of kind="blocker" --
# the daemon circuit breaker at scripts/bifrost_daemon.py:221 and :448 -- and BOTH ARE

# The middle is n/a, not no: agent_cli refuses to arm an expectation on a broadcast ("a
# broadcast has no single answerer to redrive"), so that machinery cannot apply here at all.
# The defect this closes: a tripped breaker nobody read inside the stale window was classified
