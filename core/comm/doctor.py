"""
Fleet doctor (L2 / RB-27b) -- the missing READER of the liveness signals: progress,
not presence.

Semantic Relationship: FleetDoctor diagnoses AgentLiveness (read-model; page-graded)

The 2026-07-10 mail-loss forensics' core finding: every liveness surface truthfully
said "alive and idle" while an ask was dead -- presence proves the process, never the
work. L1 (worklive) records the phase; RB-27a's pulse records progress INSIDE it; this
module is the L2 reader that turns both into graded findings, under the three-reviewer
paging table (SRE ch.6, reconciled 2026-07-11):

  PAGE-GRADE (every page urgent + actionable):
    hard_wedge        -- non-idle phase aged past threshold AND the pulse is dead: the
                         worker died inside a turn; not self-healing; act (revive).
    stalled_consumer  -- idle/online with unread backlog aged past HYSTERESIS: the
                         consumer stopped consuming. Hysteresis (first-seen must age)
                         because single-sample falses on every Redis blip.
    lane_stall        -- work on the lane has WAITED past LANE_STALL_PAGE_S. The third
                         page state, added 2026-07-26 on a receipt: kimi's lane sat 45h
                         at depth 55 while every other signal read healthy, because the
                         seat was alive and looping -- so the two states above (both of
                         which need an idle phase or a dead pulse) could not see it.
                         This one is deliberately BLIND to the pulse: presence proves
                         the process, and this module exists to say it never proves
                         the work. Graded on BACKLOG age, never cursor age -- a quiet
                         agent's cursor is ancient because no mail arrived.
  BANNER: frozen      -- a deliberate pause, with provenance + age. Config, not crisis.
  DASHBOARD: working  -- aged phase WITH a fresh pulse (F2 solved: long legit work);
             self_reported_error -- a trigger:<reason> confession (self-reported beats
                         inferred; the reason rides in the line);
             unhandled -- the P6 hours-scale count (mail loss itself is dashboard-only:
                         RB-26 auto-heals it; paging would duplicate the automation).

Healthy fleet renders ONE line. Every finding carries its drill-down command. Fixed,
named thresholds (no auto-threshold magic). Observe-only: acting (revive/redrive) stays
with the launcher and L4. Fail-open everywhere -- the doctor must never wedge a boot.
