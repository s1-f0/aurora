"""
Triage park (S0-alpha) -- the scry-to-bottom bench.

Semantic Relationship: TriagePark bottoms StaleAsks (durable bench; never a drop)

Recovery-arc S0's substrate (docs/library/design/20260701_recovery-arc-reconciled-design-superviso_ce9a9e.md: deepseek BULKHEAD-0 ∪
kimi R4 ∪ claude B1). The Canon's law: triage = scry-to-bottom -- a stale ask is BOTTOMED
to a durable per-agent bench so fresh mail flows, and it is NEVER dropped (the
graveyard-is-a-resource law applies to the bench too). RB-29 rides every park: the SENDER
is notified loudly -- an expectation settles by visible triage, not by vanishing.

Surface: <ns>:triage:<agent> (Redis list of JSON entries; durable, boot-heal covered).
S0-beta (Anvil-fenced, his loop): the consume paths call park() automatically on
D2-partitioned stale asks and advance past them. Until then: the `triage` verb is the
operator's hand -- the manual pattern that graduates, exactly like standby-hard.
