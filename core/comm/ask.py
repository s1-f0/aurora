"""ask -- a synchronous helper call, with no seat behind it (T171).

Daniil, 2026-08-04: "what if you could quickly invoke with a verb a deepseek instance to help you
with something... this might help reduce your cognitive load if you could quickly ask for help
yourself."

THE EVIDENCE THIS IS NEEDED. Across two multi-seat rounds that night, NINE seat-tasks produced TWO
findings that reached the conductor. The rest died to cursor tail-seeding, dedup collapse, budget
exhaustion returning "", and wedges -- and most of the session went on seat plumbing rather than on
getting help. Asking had become more expensive than doing it myself, so I stopped asking.

ASK IS NOT A SEAT, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. A seat carries identity, a singleton lock, cursors,
a mailbox, a heartbeat, a roster row, a wake listener and reaper protection. Every one of those
exists so a peer can be addressed ASYNCHRONOUSLY and survive without the caller. A synchronous ask
needs none of it: it is born, it answers, it dies inside one call. Today every ask has to become a
seat, which is why asking costs what it costs.

DELIBERATELY ABSENT IN v1, each for a reason:
  * TOOLS -- a tool loop is the seat path (budget, hops, wedges). Single turn first; see how it
    actually gets used before adding the machinery that broke the last two rounds.
  * PERSISTENT MEMORY -- persistence is what makes a seat. Memory that must cross invocations
    belongs in the store (learn/note) where the whole fleet can inspect it, not in N private
    shadow histories nobody can audit.
  * WRITE ACCESS -- a helper that can write is a seat with extra steps, and needs all the
    machinery back.

IT RETURNS A BoundaryOutcome, which is the point of having built one. In particular a response cut
off by `finish_reason == "length"` comes back as PARTIALLY -- the T169 lesson generalized: a helper
that ran out of room hands back what it has, marked, instead of looking complete or returning "".

    T218/T225 built the notice and T237 gave JSON callers a discoverable `warnings` list --
    and all three landed in agent_cli.py. `unusable_evidence_notice` had three call sites,
    every one of them at the CLI door, so anything that IMPORTED this module received
    `context` and no warning at all. That is most of what this fleet runs.

    It was paid for twice in one day (2026-08-08): a harness called `ask_many` directly, was
    clipped at 40,000 chars -- line 744 of an 889-line file -- and every branch went blind on
    exactly the region under study, while `context.truncated` sat True in the returned detail
    both times. Same class as T160 one level up: the function IS called, but only on the path
    a human takes.

    So the notice is minted where the metadata is minted. The door RENDERS what it is handed
    and must not recompute it: a second implementation drifts from the first, which is the
    exact risk `unusable_evidence_notice`'s own docstring gives as the reason it lives beside
    `build_context`.

    ABSENT WHEN CLEAN, deliberately -- T237's rule, and it is load-bearing. A `warnings` key
    that always appears is a banner, and a banner is how a real warning goes unread.

    Daniil, 2026-08-08, on the general shape: a fact must be glanceable and must carry the
    SENSE it is true in. "The clipped-evidence warning exists" was TRUE at the CLI door and
    FALSE at this boundary; stated unqualified it did not merely omit, it told a caller it was
    protected while it was not.

      LIBRARY (this default, False): "spending extra calls must be asked for" -- T204's ruling,
      pinned by test_t204_untruncate.test_continuation_is_opt_in. A programmatic caller has no
      human watching the spend line, so an automatic extra completion is money nobody agreed to.
      MCP, ToolBox, sift and every runner arrive through here.

      CLI (--no-continue, default True): a door may choose a policy FOR its user, and this one
      does, with the argument in its help text -- with no token ceiling a cut means the model hit
      its OWN limit, so stitching costs one completion while a re-ask pays for the whole prompt
      again (8662 tokens with --with, measured). A human sees the spend line and can say no.

    So the invariant is NOT "both defaults agree". It is: the CLI passes its choice EXPLICITLY to
    every path it owns (single ask AND fan), and the library never continues unasked. T226 pins
    that, because the fan was silently getting neither.

    Sol's front door: `ask` and `ask_peer` are one verb with two transports -- the
    stateless helper dies in the call; this one rides the bus with the full T030/T117
    settle machinery underneath, invisibly. Send + arm + poll: expectations.sweep() is
    the ACTOR (transitions), ask_state.state_of() the ORACLE (readout) -- the verb is
    the T196d state machine in a loop, so verb and readout can never disagree.

    THE ASYMMETRY IS THE POINT: wait_s is the short interactive patience; within_s is
    the long durable expectation. When the wait gives up, nothing is abandoned -- the
    record stays armed, redrives fire on their own schedule, and the caller holds a
    handle (`ask --status <id>`) instead of an error. An OPEN ask is a normal state,
    so the timeout path returns PARTIALLY, never failed.

    NON-CONSUMING BY LAW (two-live-seats): the poll reads answers from the stream
    position via the expectations anchor, never advances a lane cursor -- concurrent
    sibling sessions keep their mail; the seat's normal sync consumes later.

    T197 -- IT NOW ASKS WHETHER ANYONE IS HOME, AND SAYS SO AT t=0. The friction reader
    measured 32 closed episodes with 0 ANSWERED and 26 DEAD (81.2%) on 2026-08-06; every
    launchable agent sat at never_launched. The verdict that would have explained it
    already existed (liveness.attendance, T155) and bus.send already printed it -- to
    stderr, where this transaction discarded it. Now it is observed here, returned in
    detail["peer_at_ask"], and armed onto the record so the death event can carry it.

    OBSERVING IS NOT GATING, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS LOAD-BEARING. An UNATTENDED verdict
    NEVER stops the send (fenced with deepseek, whose argument won): a peer absent now
    can be alive by the second redrive, so refusing fast would conflate "down right now"
    with "never coming" -- destroying both the late-binding window the 30-minute
    expectation exists to catch AND the durable dead-ask evidence that found this bug.
    The caller loses nothing and learns in one second what used to cost thirty minutes
    and a forensic dig.
