"""door_probe -- does the MCP door actually answer, right now, in THIS environment?

WHY THIS EXISTS
On 2026-07-26 both the claude and codex seats hung on MCP boot(). C7-4 had regressed:
a new boot-path spawn (_head_commit_epoch) inherited the server's stdin -- the JSON-RPC
transport handle -- and Windows' Proactor then deferred the pending reply until another
inbound frame arrived. The work ran; the reply never returned.

The guard already existed. tests/test_t078_w3_mcp_door.py P6 encodes exactly "MCP boot
must not hang", it was correct and current, and it was RED -- it had simply never been
run. Detection was never the gap. DELIVERY was. This module is the delivery side.

THE DOCTRINE (docs/library/design/20260717_t091-crash-path-fable-independent-design_377190.md)
"The guard MUST live on a different substrate than the guarded op; never a timeout that
rides the wedged channel." So the probe drives the door from OUTSIDE: a real stdio client
against a real server subprocess, under a deadline the DOOR cannot influence.

WHAT IT PROBES, AND WHY BOOT SPECIFICALLY (deepseek, D1)
The hang class only manifests for a verb whose body SPAWNS A CHILD. tools/list is a pure
registry read and status reads Redis -- a probe built from those would have returned GREEN
all morning while every seat hung. That leaves boot. Boot writes, so the probe points
AI_SETUP at a temp dir: the incarnation card, presence and boot event land in the throwaway
store while the real one stays clean. This is not a test-only shortcut that could silently
stop resembling production -- it is exactly what P6 does (tmp_path + REDIS_DB 15), and P6
went red on the real bug this morning, which is the empirical proof that a temp-store boot
still exercises the hang class. It does because the leaking spawns resolve the repo from
os.path.dirname(__file__), not from AI_SETUP: real subprocess, real inherited handle, real
Proactor, zero pollution.

WHY THE PROBE CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HANG (deepseek, D3)
subprocess.run(timeout=) terminates the child and then WAITS for it; a child that refuses
to die (or is stuck in uninterruptible I/O) wedges the parent instead. If the prober hangs,
whatever called it hangs -- and a guard that becomes the outage is worse than the bug it
guards. So the deadline is defence in depth: the client work happens in a CHILD process
under the parent's OS timer, and a watchdog thread in the parent records an UNKNOWN verdict
and hard-exits if even that overruns. Corollary, and it is a rule not a preference: this
probe is for the pre-push gate and on-demand runs. It must NEVER be called inline from the
SessionStart whisper -- that path uses the cheap staleness check instead.
