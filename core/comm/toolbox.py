"""core.comm.toolbox -- the fleet's guarded tool surface (schemas + executor), shared seam.

EXTRACTED 2026-07-18 (K0, kimi runner build) from scripts/deepseek_chat.py, where it was born
and hardened -- the rule-of-three moment T090 deferred ("extraction to a neutral core module is
the post-stabilization plan"): deepseek's runner, sol's runner, and now the kimi seat all ride
this one seam. BEHAVIOR-PRESERVING MOVE: code verbatim, env names unchanged (DEEPSEEK_MAX_CMD_
TIMEOUT is historical -- every seat shares the ceiling; renaming is a separate, fenced slice).
scripts/deepseek_chat.py keeps a compat re-export so existing imports keep working.

SECURITY CONTRACT (unchanged): file access scoped to the constructor root; secrets ALWAYS
blocked; run_command gated by allow_exec/trust + the ACL families door (core.trust); writes
guarded (path-scoped, locks honored, git-reversible); ordinary output capped to bound tokens.
Recall preserves complete selected content; selection is bounded by record count.
Pins: tests/test_t067_guarded_exec.py G1-G5, tests/test_ir4_mirror_family.py, sol runner suite.

Known carried debt (pre-existing, not introduced here): lazy in-method imports reach
agent.bifrost_pull (render_collapsed) -- a core->agent reference tolerated as an allowlisted
boundary-debt entry if the checker flags it; inverting it is its own slice.

    # --- T336: the Eye at the peer door -------------------------------------------------

    # unreformatted. The Eye's renders carry their own honesty (degraded envelopes, time-fog,
    # the freq verdict) and a middleman that prettified them would be dropping exactly the
    # confessions the caller needs.

    # T338 -- DISCLOSURE, NOT PERMISSION. Daniil's ruling, 2026-08-17: "I don't want to let
    # security break the usability of this system... If the security would ruin efficiency and
    # ergonomics I'd rather lean towards ergonomics." The corpus contains his transcripts, and
    # a capability gate here would be priced on every new seat forever to prevent a rare event
    # he personally controls -- the Siemens shape, a control that exists on paper and is
    # therefore never worth using. So: no gate. Every read CONFESSES instead.
    #
    # THE PLACEMENT DOCTRINE this follows: put gates where a boundary is crossed rarely and
    # cannot be undone (the private-plane guard fires at COMMIT, where exposure is
    # irreversible); put disclosure on paths used constantly. Corpus reads happen hundreds of
    # times a session, so a gate there taxes the reading we established we do too little of.
    #
    # A gate answers "may this seat read?" once, at seating. Disclosure answers "what did it
    # actually read, and why?" forever -- which is the question that matters if a seat ever
    # does behave badly. Written where the operator can see it, and echoed to the CALLER too,
    # so a seat is never quietly observed either.
