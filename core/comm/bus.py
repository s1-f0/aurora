"""
Bifrost Bus (Slice B0) -- one ephemeral message transport for local agents, on Redis Streams.

Semantic Relationship: Agent sends Message to Agent (or broadcasts) over the Bus

This consolidates the four old comm layers into one, and fixes their bugs:
  * **Correct port.** Connects via the canonical connector (the single-source-of-truth host/port),
    not the hardcoded 6379 that `fast_agent_comm` used (real Redis is on 16379).
  * **Real fan-out.** Each agent has its OWN inbox stream (`bifrost:inbox:<agent>`); broadcasts go to a
    shared `bifrost:broadcast` stream that every agent reads from its OWN cursor -- so a broadcast reaches
    ALL agents. (The old code used a single shared consumer group, which *load-balances*, so a "broadcast"
    reached exactly one agent -- the bug.)
  * **Ephemeral, not the durable record.** This is the live transport only (Redis Streams). The durable
    "what was said" record is a separate Ledger projection (slice B2) -- the bus and the audit ledger are
    deliberately NOT conflated (design delta F1).

When Redis is down there is NO live bus -- surfaced EXPLICITLY (`online` is False, `send` returns None),
never silently swallowed. Streams are bounded (maxlen) since this is ephemeral transport.

Read model: per-agent cursors (last-read stream id for inbox + broadcast) in a Redis hash, so each agent
catches up on exactly what it missed and never re-reads (offset semantics without consumer-group coupling).

        budget). The gate is now the `{ns}:seat:born:{agent}` marker -- FIRST CITIZEN BOOT
        seeds (virgin or not) and writes the marker; a marked seat is never rewound.

        Builder's liberty vs the design (kimi to verify): the citizenship gate lives INSIDE
        this method rather than a wrapper verb, so all four runner call sites inherit the fix
