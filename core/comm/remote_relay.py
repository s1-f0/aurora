"""Remote peer relay — the OUTBOUND half of the Akashic↔Akashic bridge (v0.1).

Daniil, 2026-08-24: "design an akashic aurora to akashic aurora bridge ... so Serge's DSH
agent can communicate with us ... I don't want everyone having access."
Design: docs/library/design/remote-bifrost-bridge-design.md (fence: remote-bridge).

STATUS: v1. Outbound (push/enqueue/tick) AND the inbound gate (accept) are both live; the
HTTP door is scripts/remote_bridge_listener.py. v0.1 was outbound-only ON PURPOSE — a peer
relay is a prompt-injection door into a fleet holding a shell, a repo and an API budget, so
inbound shipped only once it had an identity pin, HMAC + replay window, the kind allowlist,
redaction, and parked-not-bussed delivery. That sequencing was the point, not a delay.

(This paragraph read "V0 IS OUTBOUND-ONLY" for half a day after inbound shipped. A module
docstring is a claim about the code, and it rots the moment the code moves — Zadkiel found
three such rotted claims in this file at once.)

WHAT V0 GUARANTEES (the three load-bearing properties, each inherited not invented):

1. NO CREDENTIAL ON GITHUB. The committed config (state/coord/remote_bridge.json) names the
   peer URL + which secret FILE, never the secret. The secret is HMAC material in
   .secrets/ (already gitignored), captured through the vault door
   `py agent_cli.py secret remote_bridge_outbound.key`, handed to the peer out-of-band.

2. NOT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS. Outbound direction is one peer (the configured route). Holding
   our outbound secret lets an attacker push INTO Serge's relay only — not read us, not
   steer us, not enumerate. Inbound (the actually dangerous direction) does not exist in v0.

3. ROBUST — AT-LEAST-ONCE, NOT FIRE-AND-FORGET. Messages carry a stable id; a durable
   outbox cursor records the last-acked id; on any post failure the message is NOT dropped
   (it stays un-acked and is replayed on the next tick). A redelivered copy is harmless
   because the receiver dedupes by id (RB-26 house law, carried from the bus).

NEIGHBOUR LAW: this module copies discord_bridge's GUARDS, not just its shape — allowlist
never denylist, visible redaction, absent-is-not-broken, never raise into a bus caller,
injectable transport so every pin runs offline. It still imports discord_bridge's REDACTION,
so credential-scrubbing cannot fork. It deliberately does NOT share the allowlist: see
BRIDGE_KINDS for why FORWARD_KINDS answers a different question, and why the anti-drift
guarantee moved to a pin instead.
