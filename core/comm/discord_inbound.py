"""Discord inbound — Daniil's Discord messages become his voice on the bus. Nothing else does.

Born 2026-08-19, the night he typed into #aurora and asked what happened to his message
(answer: nothing — the house had a voice there and no inbound path). This module is the R1-R3
security model of discord-bridge-design-2026-08-07 made executable, pins in
tests/test_discord_inbound_pins.py:

  R1  the operator allowlist is ONE numeric Discord id. Display names are costume —
      an author named "Daniil" with the wrong id is weather.
  R2  every non-allowlisted message is DATA, never instruction. v1 does not even
      surface it; it returns unacted and the runner moves on.
  R3  reach, never authority. The ear's ONLY write into the house is a bus send AS
      the operator — a Discord message can do exactly what a bifrost-send from his
      keyboard could, from farther away. No task verbs, no grant, no shell. The route
      (which ask a room-message belongs to) comes from the ROOMS REGISTRY, never from
      message content.

This module is PURE and hermetic: no discord.py, no network, no token. The gateway
shell (scripts/bifrost_runner_discord.py) owns the credential and the socket; everything
decidable is decided here where pins can reach it.

    the thing to not drift back into. 2026-08-31 it auto-SPAWNED a headless `claude -p`
    whenever the roster showed nothing live, to fix "Vandor is unreachable without
    !spawn". That fixed reachability by manufacturing a stranger: every ordinary sentence
    could mint a brand-new seat with none of the session's context.

    2026-09-04 ruling (Daniil, verbatim above): a plain message NEVER spawns. When a seat
    IS live the durable send is the whole mechanism -- its armed wake listener fires and
    the harness re-invokes THAT session, which is what "reach you specifically" means.
    When nothing is live he gets COLD_SEAT_NOTICE and picks the harness himself, because
    `--harness` (an interactive session) and `--headless` (a one-shot) are different
    animals and only he knows which one he wants.

    Returns None (nothing spawned, ever) or the notice string when the seat is cold.
    Never raises: the bus.send this follows already succeeded, and a wake-path failure
    must not turn an already-landed, already-receipted message into a reported failure
    (T149: no lie in either direction). `is_seat_reachable is None` means the caller wired no
    probe -- stay silent rather than cry cold about a seat we cannot see."""
