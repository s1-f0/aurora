"""
Bifrost control plane -- human-in-the-loop PAUSE + runaway-loop guard for live agent collaboration.

Two safety mechanisms for a shared bus where agents wake each other (co-designed with DeepSeek, which
flagged the echo-loop risk unprompted -- two auto-answering runners can ping-pong forever, burning
tokens):

1. PAUSE (barge-in). One shared Redis flag the human can set to freeze the auto-responders. A runner
   checks is_paused() at the top of its loop; while paused it does NOT consume/answer, so incoming
   mail simply queues on the Streams until resume(). Lets a human interject mid-exchange with nothing
   lost. Shared (Redis) so the UI, the CLI, or an agent can all set it.

2. LOOP-GUARD (runaway prevention), two layers:
   - HOP COUNT (primary). Every auto-reply carries meta['hops']; a runner refuses to answer once the
     incoming hops >= MAX_HOPS, bouncing the thread back to a human. Bounds any A<->B ping-pong to
     MAX_HOPS turns no matter what.
   - RATE LIMIT (backstop). A runner may auto-reply at most MAX_REPLIES_PER_MIN (sliding 60s window);
     beyond that it auto-pauses the whole bus and says so. Catches runaway even if hop-count is bypassed
     (e.g. a third agent, or a bug that resets hops).

Both fail-open on any Redis error (never wedge the bus) and are ADVISORY -- honored by cooperating
runners, same trust model as the advisory path-locks. Tunable via env: BIFROST_MAX_HOPS,
BIFROST_MAX_REPLIES_PER_MIN.
