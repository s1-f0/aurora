"""bifrost.api -- the one door an agent uses to join and work the Bifrost bus.

Instead of wiring Bus + control + nudge + the wake listener + presence separately, an agent onboards
with a single object:

    api = BifrostAPI("myagent")
    api.online()                       # announce presence
    api.broadcast("hello, I'm here")   # or api.send("claude", "...")
    for m in api.inbox(): ...          # read what's waiting
    api.nudge("claude", "look now")    # or api.steer(...) -- signal a peer
    # stay wakeable from idle: arm  api.wake_cmd  as a background task

The elegant artifact that gathers the free-floating bus primitives (send / receive / wake / presence /
signals / intent) behind one agent-facing interface. Every method is a thin, honest delegation to the
underlying primitive -- no new behavior, just one place to reach them. Fail-open like the primitives:
a bus outage degrades to no-ops / empty, never an exception into the agent's loop.

    MEASURED on prod 2026-08-14, and the measurement took three attempts because the first
    two were measuring the wrong thing. The number that stands, taken through THIS module's
    own _dedup_key and _work_lane_shas AND its own R12 population filter:

        50 peeked legacy packets
        45 work-lane ELIGIBLE (R12 excludes trace/sig-routed kinds)
        45 cursor-skew, 0 lane-write-failed

    A drain over that same traffic reported "14 LEGACY STRAGGLER(S) -- lane write failed
    upstream". Zero of them were.

    The two discarded attempts are recorded because each was wrong in an instructive way.
    A hand-rolled version that read raw stream fields and built its own dedup tuples said
    0/60 -- right answer, mirrored detector, so it was not evidence. Redoing it through this
    module's predicate but NOT its population filter said 5 failed writes, all from conductor
    six days earlier with kinds ledger_update and resolved -- and lane_for() routes both to
    'trace', so the real filter would never have looked at them. Borrowing a detector's
    predicate without its population manufactures defects it would never claim.

    The old test was "not in `seen`", where `seen` holds the dedup keys of THIS batch's work
    read. The two lanes are read from independently-positioned cursors (measured skew that
    day: 33 unread on work, 49 on legacy), so every packet the work read had already passed
    or not yet reached looked like a transport defect. It was reporting cursor skew as a
    failed write, and its text told the reader to "investigate the sender side" -- which is
    where another seat's investigation went.

    Returns: "lane-write-failed" | "cursor-skew" | "unknown". UNKNOWN when the membership

        detection never runs the flip ritual, because seeding a migrant's lane hash at
