"""ask_bg -- a helper call that outlives your turn without becoming a seat (T205).

THE FRICTION THIS REMOVES, measured on 2026-08-06. Every fence that day ran serially --
24s, 43s, 48s, 54s of dead wall-clock each -- because `ask` blocks and its answer lands in
the caller's context whole. The fan primitive existed (ask_many, six workers) and was
unaffordable for exactly one reason: attention, not capability. So I asked two helpers
instead of six and paid the latency on both.

T204 removed the other half of the problem by taking the token ceiling off: with output
landing in a file rather than a context window, there is no longer any reason for a
background answer to hold back.

STILL NOT A SEAT (T171's law, and pinned). No identity, no singleton lock, no cursor, no
mailbox, no heartbeat, no roster row, no reaper protection. A backgrounded ask is a CALL
whose result lands somewhere durable instead of in the caller's window. Nothing addresses
it but the handle its caller holds -- which is also why it needs no wake machinery at all.

DESIGNED AGAINST ONE SPECIFIC FAILURE: this repo has 1,324 unopened mailbox items. "Write
it somewhere and check it later" is precisely the pattern that produced them. So:
  * the handle is printed immediately and `--get` is one hop
  * RUNNING, DONE, FAILED and ORPHANED are four distinct readings -- an unfinished ask must
    never look like an empty answer, or the reader learns to stop looking
  * a record whose process is gone but whose status never advanced reads ORPHANED, so a
    dead child cannot look busy forever (the wedge shape this fleet already knows)

    not demand attention -- the right default for something that may fire dozens of times
    an hour. Waking someone stays opt-in, because a notification that always fires is how
    a reader learns to ignore notifications.

    IT IS ALSO THE ANCHOR THE METRICS LACKED. Sol's friction list named commands per task,
    operator interventions and recovery time, and all three were unbuildable because
    nothing durable recorded a DELEGATION. This does: cost, duration, model, outcome,
    truncation class, and whether the ask was grounded in files.
