"""Governed task ledger — the deterministic coordination substrate (Phase 1: sequential-correct).

WHY: the fleet reworks + confuses itself because agents read an append-only MESSAGE stream and infer
intent — a three-hour-old "apply the perf fix" reads as a live directive even though it's long done.
The fix: make TASKS (not messages) the unit of coordination, with a validated lifecycle. Agents read
the LEDGER (curated current truth), never the raw backlog. Anything DONE is closed.

GOVERN BY THE ENVIRONMENT, DETERMINISTICALLY: invalid transitions are REJECTED here in code — no model
in the loop deciding what's allowed. A misbehaving agent physically cannot rework, clobber, or close
work without proof, because these gates block it.

Slice A (this file): the pure state machine + validated transitions + git-durable JSON persistence.
Slice B adds the Redis mirror for fast reads; C wires boot/wake to read-state-first; D the conductor.

Gates enforced here:
- transition validity  — only lifecycle-legal moves (TRANSITIONS).
- claim gate           — an APPROVED task, all deps DONE, its files held by no other active task, not
                         already done.
- one-in-progress gate — Phase 1: at most ONE task IN_PROGRESS globally (sequential-correct).
- done gate            — cannot close without a commit SHA + a verification record. No proof, no close.

    THE LIMIT, STATED HERE BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS: this reads the task's DECLARED
    files. It never sees the diff. A task declaring `files=["README.md"]` while editing
    `core/` is not gated, and nothing here can notice. That makes the gate a SPEED BUMP, not a
    wall -- it catches the honest omission, not the determined one, and it is worth having for
    exactly that. A guard believed to be a wall is more dangerous than one known to be a bump.

    The same threat model covers a second bypass a reviewer found and I am not fixing: a
    homoglyph path (`\u0441ore/x.py` with a Cyrillic U+0441) fails segment equality and slips
    through. Defeating that means confusable-detection, and NFKC does not even solve it -- a
    large mechanism against an attacker this gate has already conceded, while the honest
    omission it exists to catch is caught. Both limits are here so the next reader inherits the
    threat model rather than rediscovering it.

    Path spelling is normalised because it varied in practice (T250): backslashes, a leading
    './', absolute paths, and non-leading '../' segments all reached this function and three of
    the four escaped a naive prefix test. Matching is done on PATH SEGMENTS, so `core/` matches
    `core/comm/ask.py` and `/srv/repo/core/x.py` but never `core.py`, `mycore/x.py` or
    `score/x.py` -- those non-matches are correct and are pinned so a later widening cannot
