"""defer_queue — the capability-gated standing queue (W33, seat-zero wave B3).

Commands that WAIT FOR A SEAT WITH A CAPABILITY the filing seat lacks (exec, write).
Born from kimi's GREEN queue riding handoff prose: "four one-liners for the next exec
seat" buried in a 3KB message body, discharged only because that seat read carefully.
This registry makes the queue first-class: file with `defer`, surface at boot, discharge
with a receipt.

Consensus laws (claude opening + kimi counter, night-run 2026-07-21):
  COMMANDS-NOT-CHARTERED-WORK — a mini-registry, not task-ledger entries; the ledger's
    gates are wrong-weight for "run these one-liners" (Q2, both seats agree). It reuses
    the ledger's FILE DISCIPLINE (git-durable state/*.json, atomic replace — the K0
    atomicity lesson) without its transitions.
  RECEIPT-ON-DONE (kimi b, blocking) — discharge REQUIRES a receipt string; a queue
    where items vanish stampless is a graveyard. History is never deleted.
  CAPABILITY-AWARE RENDER (kimi a, blocking) — a seat whose ACL lacks the needed cap
    gets ONE dim line ("not you"), never a shouted work list (the W03/W40 genus).
    Honest residual: session-level harness gates (a write-gated seat of a caps-holding
    agent) are invisible here; the ACL gates the render, the seat self-selects live.
  CAPPED SECTION (kimi d) — boot shows at most BOOT_CAP items + "+M more".
