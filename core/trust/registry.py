"""
Grant registry -- the reader over security/acl.json (source of truth), mirroring core/fleet/model_roster.py (renamed from roster.py at 425cf52; T123 duplicate-basename class).

The one function the doors call is `resolve(agent_id, verified=...)`: it returns the EFFECTIVE Grant an
agent acts under, fail-closed to QUARANTINED for anything unknown, unverified, or expired. Enforcement
(ToolBox/Bus) reads caps off the returned Grant; it never trusts a raw role string.

Storage is a git-tracked JSON file. A small in-process mtime cache avoids re-reading on every check; a
Redis cache layer is a later optimization (the file is always the fallback truth).
