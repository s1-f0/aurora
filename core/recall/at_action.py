"""Recall-at-action (`core/recall`) — read the right knowledge AT THE MOMENT of action.

Semantic Relationship: Recall surfaces ActiveKnowledge for a PointOfAction (path | command)

The pain this closes: storage is passive — lessons are written far more than they are read when
they matter. Given the file path or shell command an agent is about to act on, return the FEW
highest-signal ACTIVE items (relevant lessons + a lock/peer-activity warning) with `source`
pointers. The one reusable engine consumed by BOTH the `recall-at` CLI verb AND the PreToolUse
hook's `additionalContext` (so it is wired by construction, never built-but-not-wired).

Design — deterministic, no-LLM, fail-soft (SOTA-informed; see docs/library/design/20260709_agent-experience-plan-akashic-aurora_405872.md):
- **keyword/path-first relevance** via the shared Ranker (no embedding on the hot path).
- **SHOW NOTHING unless it clears a relevance floor** — a weak, off-topic hint at action-time is
  worse than silence (context-rot). We gate on the Ranker's RELEVANCE component specifically, not
  the blended score, so a merely-important-but-irrelevant lesson never fires.
- **cap at a few entries** (default 3) — complete selected fields with `source` pointers.
- **FAITH-1 gate** — recalled text runs through `faithfulness_report`; nothing unfaithful (a
  fabricated/unresolvable pointer) ever reaches the agent.
- **provenance-labelled** — each item is prefixed with outcome-status + author + claim-kind
  (worked / partial / unverified / anti-pattern; `advice` marks a forward-looking recommendation),
  so a self-authored, unverified hypothesis never returns framed as an external verified fact
  (Factor 1: opinion-laundering). Status reflects the AUTHOR'S OWN report (`worked` = self-reported
  success, not an independent check). The store already holds this; projection carries it to the surface.
- **fully degrades to empty** on any error — a recall path must never brick the action.

LATENCY: lesson items are served from a TTL disk cache (a fresh hook process can't hold an in-memory
one), so after warm-up a call is a ~1ms file read + rank, not a store round-trip. On a cold/down store
the cache returns last-known-good (stale fallback) instead of empty — this kills the cold-start empty.
The PreToolUse hook is also non-blocking + fail-open, so even a cold first call delays a hint, never the
action. Anti-repeat (don't re-surface a lesson already shown this session) is handled by the hook via
`exclude_sources`. Tunables: AKASHIC_RECALL_CACHE_TTL (sec), AKASHIC_RECALL_AT_ACTION=0 (off).

    STAGE SEPARATION (the 2026-07-25 four-seat debate's unanimous result). "surfaced",
    "applied", "outcome" and "attributed" must be DISTINCT events, because an aggregate
    cannot name which funnel stage is failing. codex decomposed it: C/N = (R/N)(S/R)(A/S)
    (F/A)(C/F) -- four credited flips proves the PRODUCT is tiny and cannot say WHICH
    factor is. Before this function, outcome and attribution were FUSED into the flip
    record, and the record was written ONLY when a flip occurred.

    That is the expensive blindness. kimi, verified in this file: the credited-flip
    numerator counts RESCUE, never PREVENTION -- "a first-try success credits and logs
    nothing" was the contrastive gate, by design -- so the single most valuable thing a
    lesson can do (stop the failure from happening at all) was invisible to the only value
    metric the system had. Daniel's bar is that agents PREFER the store, and you prefer
    what stops you failing, not what rescues you.

    This event makes the prevention numerator computable for the first time:
        success AND surfaced AND NOT flipped  -> a PREVENTION candidate
        success AND NOT surfaced              -> its CONTROL arm
    The contrastive first-try-success rate falls straight out of that pair.

    OBSERVATION ONLY -- nothing here feeds ranking. The debate showed BOTH feedback loops
    are confounded (the positive by self-inflation; the negative by exposure-bias, and
    is_benched makes it self-sealing: a demoted lesson stops surfacing, so it can never
    earn the credit that would redeem it). No automatic steer may ride this signal until
    the stages are separately observed. Carries agent_id so cross-seat questions become
    answerable. Fail-soft by contract: a PostToolUse hook must never affect the action.
