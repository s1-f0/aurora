Ledger: Swappable event-record interface (append-and-replay)

Semantic Relationship: Ledger records_events_for Agents

WHY THIS EXISTS (and why it is NOT the Store, nor a message bus)
---------------------------------------------------------------
`Store` answers "what IS the current value of X?" -- state you read back by key.
`Ledger` answers "what HAPPENED, in order?" -- events you append and replay.
These are two different mental models, and Redis itself models them differently
(key/value/hash/etc. vs. streams). Conflating them under one interface would
make every call site ambiguous, so events get their own primitive, symmetric
with Store. Store + Ledger is the classic systems pairing: the store holds
current values, the ledger records the ordered sequence of events.

This is NOT a real-time message bus: nothing is pushed. An emitter appends an
event; a reader replays everything after a bookmark (cursor), in order, whenever
it wants. It is a durable, ordered, replayable record -- a ledger.

Relationship to chronicles/: this ledger is the RAW firehose -- every event
every agent emits. A "chronicle" (the curated highlights: decisions, failures,
milestones) is a distilled view DERIVED FROM this ledger, not the ledger
itself. Keep the two distinct: ledger = everything in order, chronicle = the
significant few.

Use the Ledger for signal transport (an agent emits a DECISION; the coordinator
replays the stream and reacts). Use the Store for queryable state (a learning
you look up later). Recording a fact -> Store. Announcing something that
happened -> Ledger.

THREE BACKENDS (mirrors Store exactly)
--------------------------------------
- RedisLedger  : Redis Streams (xadd/xread). Built on the fail-fast connector,
                  so a down Redis yields an unavailable ledger rather than a stall.
- FileLedger   : append-only JSONL per stream (always available, survives
                  restarts, zero infrastructure). The durable record.
- HybridLedger : append to both, read Redis-first with File fallback. Default.

EVENT MODEL
-----------
Callers emit and receive plain dicts. The Ledger owns the wire detail (Redis
stores each event as a {"data": <json>} field map; FileLedger stores one JSON
line per event). Each event gets an id; consumers pass the last id back as
`after_id` to resume. Ids are backend-specific and only comparable within one
backend -- consumers should treat them as opaque cursors and dedup downstream if
a backend switch replays (the coordinator already dedups by agent_id:signal_number).

    Always available, survives restarts, needs no infrastructure; the durable record of
    every event. Cursor ids are a monotonic per-stream integer (as a string) so they stay
    comparable even after `maxlen` trimming.

    CROSS-PROCESS (2026-09-24, L0 of the DuckDB synthesis). emit() appends ONE line while
    holding an OS lock every process shares (core.foundation.filelock, a sidecar
    `<stream>.jsonl.lock`), and reads only the file's tail to find the next id. It used to
    read the whole file, rewrite it through one fixed tmp name and os.replace it, guarded by
    a threading lock no other process could see: two writers read the same state, the later
    replace won, and the other row vanished -- 410 of 18,170 recall outcomes, 09-10..24.
    On Windows os.replace also fails while any reader holds the file open, and that failure
    was swallowed after emit had already chosen an id. Pinned in
    tests/test_ledger_cross_process.py.

    `maxlen` trimming is amortized: a stream may run maxlen // 10 rows past its cap before
    one rewrite trims it back to the newest `maxlen` (exact for small caps) -- the "roughly"
    the Ledger contract always promised. A trim that cannot replace the file because a reader
    holds it is skipped and retried by a later emit. The row was appended before the trim was
    attempted, so a failed trim costs disk, never data.
