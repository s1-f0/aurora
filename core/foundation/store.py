Store: Swappable persistence interface (full Redis-mirror)

Semantic Relationship: Store abstracts_persistence_for AllSystems

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Before this, Redis was hardcoded across the codebase and every module
re-implemented its own "try Redis, fall back to files" branching. That made
the backend impossible to swap and duplicated the same logic 5+ times.

`Store` is the single seam. It mirrors the Redis command surface the codebase
actually uses (key/value, hash, list, set, sorted-set, key-scan) so domain
modules can keep their existing data-structure logic but persist THROUGH the
Store instead of talking to Redis directly. Swapping persistence = swapping the
Store instance; no domain code changes.

THREE BACKENDS
--------------
- RedisStore  : real Redis (fast, shared, networked). Built on the fail-fast
                connector so construction never stalls when Redis is down.
- FileStore   : JSON-file emulation of every structure (always available,
                survives restarts, zero infrastructure).
- HybridStore : dual-write to both, read Redis-first with File fallback. This
                is the default for graceful degradation.

VALUE SEMANTICS
---------------
Mirrors redis-py with decode_responses=True: keys, values, hash fields/values,
list items, set members, and zset members are all str. Sorted-set scores are
float. This keeps RedisStore a thin pass-through and FileStore byte-compatible
with what callers already expect.
