"""SqliteStore -- the durable Store backend with real cross-process safety.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
FileStore serialises its WHOLE in-memory dict on every mutation and os.replace's it over
the shared path. Two processes each hold a full copy, so the second flush erases the first
writer's keys. Measured 2026-07-25 with an isolated 3-process probe: 450 writes attempted,
155 survived, 295 LOST -- 65.6% silent loss, no error raised, one worker's entire output
erased while it believed every write had succeeded.

Its cas() did not help: it compares against the same in-memory dict under a threading.RLock,
so it is blind across processes AND across instances (each FileStore builds its own lock).
A cross-process probe had every cas() return True, zero conflicts reported, and the child's
committed key gone.

Same probe against this class: 450 attempted, 450 survived, 0 lost.

WHY SQLITE AND NOT A LOCK AROUND THE OLD DESIGN
-----------------------------------------------
A lock alone is insufficient -- it guards the critical section while the compare still reads
stale in-memory state, so the section is correct-by-lock and wrong-by-data (kimi). The fix
has to make the compare read CURRENT state. SQLite does that natively: writes serialise, the
compare happens inside the engine, and there is no whole-file rewrite to clobber with.

Chosen over LMDB (zset scores are mutable, and maintaining score order in a key-sorted B-tree
needs a secondary index or a full scan -- "the zset encoding alone is a design project") and
over per-key files (fixes the hole but every list/set/zset mutation becomes a full-structure
rewrite). Both assessments are deepseek's, which priced its own per-key proposal and rejected
it. Full analysis: docs/filestore-coherence-design-2026-07.md,
research/reviewed/storage-engine-sweep-2026-07-26.md.

THE TWO RIDERS, both measured rather than assumed
-------------------------------------------------
1. CHECKPOINT POLICY IS MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. Probed 2026-07-26: with one long-lived
   reader holding an open read transaction, the -wal file grew to 523,272 bytes and would
   not truncate; it fell to 0 only after the reader released AND an explicit
   wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE) ran. Our runners and UI ARE long-lived readers, so this is our
   exact shape. See checkpoint() and wal_bytes() below -- the WAL size is a health signal,
   not something to discover as disk pressure.

2. BACKUP MUST NOT BE A FILE COPY. Copying the .db alone leaves the -wal behind and yields a
   stale-or-corrupt snapshot while still reporting success. Use backup_to(), which wraps
   sqlite3's online backup API. scripts/ops/snapshot_knowledge.py and
   scripts/harmonize_knowledge.py currently shutil.copy2 the store file and MUST be moved
   onto backup_to() in the same slice, or we trade a write-loss defect for a recovery-loss
   defect on the path memory records as "proven".

WHAT THIS CLASS DOES NOT PROTECT (kimi's ROT-2 -- a fix must name its own coverage)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anything writing the .db file outside this class. deepseek's writer census found zero such
  paths for the JSON store; the same discipline must hold here.
- Multi-key atomicity ACROSS separate calls. Each method is atomic; a caller doing
  get-then-set across two calls still races. That is what cas() and update_atomic() are for.
- A reader that holds a transaction open indefinitely still starves the checkpoint. The
  policy mitigates; it does not make the hazard vanish.
