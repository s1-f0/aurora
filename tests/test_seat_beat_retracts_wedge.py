"""A working Claude Code seat must not page HARD WEDGE.

WHAT HAPPENED, 2026-08-02. This seat paged `HARD WEDGE -- 'working' for 2878s with a DEAD pulse`
repeatedly across a long session while it was continuously active -- editing, rendering, running
tests. It fired at 1022s, again at 2878s, and each page carried the drill "relaunch the runner"
for a seat that has no runner and needed no relaunching.

THE DETECTOR WAS RIGHT AND WAS STARVED. core/comm/doctor.py pages on: non-idle phase, aged past
DEFAULT_WEDGE_S, AND no alive signal. It already accepts a SEAT's worklive beat as that signal, and
the reasoning there is careful and correct -- a RUNNER's heartbeat runs on its own thread and can
keep beating while the main thread is blocked (py-spy caught exactly that live), so a runner's beat
proves PROCESS liveness and never WORK progress. A seat is single-threaded per turn, so its beat IS
work evidence and may retract a page.

The gap: a seat's beat was only written on sync/boot. A Claude Code turn that runs for forty
minutes of solid tool calls without calling either goes silent, ages past the threshold, and pages
at precisely the moment it is working hardest. The retraction path existed; nothing fed it.

THE FIX. A tool call is the strongest available proof that a turn is alive and advancing, and it
already flows through the activity hook added earlier the same day. That hook now also beats the
seat's worklive, carrying the PHASE -- so the doctor sees non-idle work with a fresh beat and emits
its 'genuinely working, not wedged' dashboard line instead of a page.

WHAT THESE PINS ARE. Structural assertions over the hook sources plus a direct exercise of the
doctor's own decision. They cannot reproduce a 48-minute turn; they CAN prove that the beat is
wired into the tool-call path in both hook copies, and that a fresh seat beat suppresses the page
while a stale one still raises it. The second half matters as much as the first: a fix that made
the pager unable to fire would be worse than the false positive it replaced.
