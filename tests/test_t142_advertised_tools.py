"""PRE-REGISTERED ACCEPTANCE (T142) -- a doc that names a TOOL must name one that exists.

ERRATUM, and the SECOND time in one day I did this. Commit 6b494b9 and the RED commit before it say
"T141". The ledger had already issued T141 at 23:31:49 to an unrelated entry (a T140 child on
cognitive-snapshot validity). The real id for this work is T142.

What makes it worth writing down rather than quietly fixing: this morning I closed four entries
whose ids and contents disagree, filed a lesson named identifiers_minted_before_the_registry_speaks_collide,
and wrote in it "MINT THE IDENTIFIER FIRST, THEN WRITE." I then chose T141 by reading the list
instead of asking the registry -- the exact move the lesson forbids -- while a concurrent seat was
minting from the same list. The recall hook surfaced my own lesson back at me minutes later.

It was caught by codex_root, a seat I had just DECLINED privileges to, which paused on the ACL and
sent a stop-notice rather than proceeding. Knowing a rule is not the same as having a mechanism for
it, and a quarantined peer reading the ledger was the mechanism.

MEASURED 2026-08-03 by a five-seat DeepSeek round on the wiring/verb/tools surface. The COLD SEAT
(deepseek-ui, read-only by grant) was asked to do three ordinary things using only the discovery
surfaces a newcomer gets. It could not complete STEP ONE:

    AGENTS.md:18   py agent_cli.py boot <your_agent_id> --task "..."

It has no shell. `run_command` is gated by allow_exec/trust plus the ACL families door, and
security/acl.json quarantines unlisted agents to read-only BY DEFAULT -- so the default new agent
cannot run the first command the door contract gives it. The capability it needed existed the whole
time: `knowledge_boot` at core/comm/toolbox.py:486. AGENTS.md contained ZERO mentions of the tool
surface -- not knowledge_boot, not knowledge_learn, not toolbox.

That is this repo's own signature defect seen from the other side. check_wiring hunts capability
with no door pointing at it; this is a DOOR with no pointer to the capability. The fix (a two-door
fork at the top of AGENTS.md) is one edit and would drift back in a month, so it gets a guard.

check_advertised_verbs.py already enforces the shell half: every `py agent_cli.py <verb>` in live
code must resolve. Nothing enforced the tool half. These pins are that twin.

WHY THE MATCHING IS NAMESPACE-SCOPED, and not "any identifier that looks like a tool". Prefixes with
only ONE real tool (read_, write_, list_, run_) are ordinary English in this codebase --
`write_tombstone`, `read_verdict`, `list_parked` are core functions, not tools. Flagging those
would produce exactly the false-positive flood that makes a guard get silenced. So only genuine
NAMESPACES count -- a prefix carrying two or more real tools (bifrost_, knowledge_, git_, memory_).
Same reasoning the sibling gate records twice: a guard that cries wolf gets fed exceptions until it
guards nothing.

  T1  a doc naming a tool that does not exist is REPORTED
  T2  a doc naming a real tool is NOT reported
  T3  a filename is not a tool call            (scripts/bifrost_runner_deepseek.py must not flag)
  T4  single-tool prefixes are not a namespace (write_tombstone must not flag)
  T5  AGENTS.md names the tool-surface door    (regression guard for the fix that prompted this)
