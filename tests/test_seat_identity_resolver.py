"""PRE-REGISTERED acceptance for the session-scoped seat identity resolver (fold 2 + fold 1).

Registered BEFORE any implementation, per M3. These pins are RED at registration time and
that is the point: git must show acceptance preceded implementation.

WHY THIS EXISTS -- the defect, measured, not theorised (2026-08-01):
Every Claude Code hook resolves "who am I" from ONE PROCESS-WIDE env var, AKASHIC_AGENT_ID,
whose hardcoded fallback is the literal string "claude" -- the conductor's name. The env comes
from a settings.json shared by every home-rooted session, and a running session cannot mutate
its own process env, so a seat CANNOT declare its own identity. Live consequences on one
session in one day:
  * one physical session held TWO roster rows -- claude#6ac75463 LIVE (hook-beaten, wrong name)
    and opus-engineer#6ac75463 DEAD 3.6h (correct name, nothing beats it), while working
  * the conductor read absence-from-roster as death, wrote "your seat died 10h ago", and
    redelivered one brief four times
  * the stop hook's wakeability check searched for the CLAUDE-named watcher, could not see the
    correctly-named one, and prescribed arming a duplicate under the conductor's name -- a
    guardrail crying wolf AND handing over the wrong medicine (three firings)
  * advisory path-locks became unusable: a lock taken as opus-engineer locked the SAME session
    out of its own files, because the lock hook resolved the holder as claude

THE RULE THESE PINS ENCODE, and it is the transferable half:
A missing identity must FAIL LOUD, never silently borrow a real peer's name. Substituting
"claude" does not merely lose information -- it IMPERSONATES, and every downstream organ
(roster, reaper, locks, traces, wake) then attributes one seat's work to another. XMPP's
Bind 2 settles the same case by REFUSING a stanza with no explicit sender (unknown-sender);
we take the same posture, downgraded to a loud unknown-<sid8> because a hook must never
break a session.

solve this with a two-level name plus an explicit binding step).
