"""Pins for the auto-handoff keepalive — the draft must survive an ungraceful death.

2026-08-24. `chronicles/last-session-draft.md` is the auto-handoff, written by the
SessionEnd/PreCompact hook. Both are GRACEFUL exits. At 12:01:59 the conductor's GPU
process crashed; neither hook fired; no draft was written. The file on disk afterwards is
stamped 14:46:12 — from a session that ended cleanly after the recovery. The seats that
reconstructed the outage did it from raw logs.

The safety net was attached to the happy path, which is this day's recurring shape.

These pins govern the throttle decision and the never-raise contract. The trigger is NOT
wired yet, deliberately: the natural one is the Stop hook, which runs on every turn of
every claude session, so a defect there wedges the fleet rather than a seat.

          pinned throttle + the one existing draft builder) and lib/index.js fires it
          fire-and-forget from tools/post-execute, so a taskkill /F on the DSH host
