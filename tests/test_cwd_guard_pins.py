"""PIN: the cwd-guard (_cwd_drift) in the PreToolUse hook, agent/harness/hooks/claude_pretooluse.py.

Defer 21f178ad26 (claude, 2026-09-01): "write the RED pin for _cwd_drift ... drift speaks, anchored
stays guard-quiet, in-repo untouched -- the 3-case stdin drill from 2026-09-01 is the spec". The
guard shipped in b095caa5 (out-of-scope branch) and 5b65b7ab (in-scope-by-text branch) with stdin
drill receipts but no committed pin; M3 wants the acceptance durable in the suite.

THE MECHANISM. The harness shell resets to E:\\ whenever it rebuilds. A repo-shaped command
(scripts/, core/, agent_cli.py ...) issued from that drifted cwd either FALSE-CLEANS (grep over
absent dirs reports zero hits) or dies file-not-found (py agent_cli.py). Before b095caa5 the
out-of-scope branch of main() was a silent no-op by design (user-level registration must stay
quiet outside this repo), so the reset was invisible. _cwd_drift is ORTHOGONAL to scope: it emits
one loud additionalContext line -- never a deny -- on BOTH scope branches (out-of-scope: the line
alone; in-scope: folded in FRONT of recall), and stays quiet for anchored commands
(cd /e/AI-Setup && ..., absolute repo paths), for a cwd already inside E:\\AI-Setup, and for
non-repo work that mentions no repo marker.

WHICH FILE. The guard used to live only in the scripts/hooks/ twin. Since the hook trees were
unified, agent/harness/hooks/claude_pretooluse.py is the one body and scripts/hooks/ holds a runpy
shim onto it, so this pin loads the canonical file by path under a unique module name.
RED against b095caa5~1 (the tree before the guard existed); GREEN at HEAD.

Recall is replaced by a sentinel at the hook's own seam (_recall_context), so every case is
Redis-free by construction and the FOLD ORDER (drift line first, recall after) is pinned rather
than assumed. scope.py roots itself at the checkout it lives in, so the one case that needs the
in-scope-BY-CWD branch pins that root to the production topology (E:\\AI-Setup); a worktree would
otherwise route it through the out-of-scope branch and certify nothing.
