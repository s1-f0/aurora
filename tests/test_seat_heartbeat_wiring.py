"""SEAT HEARTBEAT WIRING pins -- RED first (M3).

WHY THIS EXISTS. Measured 2026-08-01: 89 seats in the roster, ZERO live. `roster.heartbeat`
(core/comm/roster.py:103) has ONE production caller, agent/bifrost_pull.py, reached only from
boot / manual sync / SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit. WORKLIVE_TTL_S is 180, so a seat working
continuously inside one turn reads DEAD after three minutes. Three organs consume that sensor
as truth -- the reaper (reaper.py:90 treats DEAD as reapable), the bus UNATTENDED RECIPIENT
warning, and doctor's "genuinely working" retraction. The conductor seat that wrote today's
handover read two live peers as dead and re-sent one brief four times, because the instrument
told it they were corpses. Fix: beat from the PostToolUse hook -- a genuine per-action tick.

WHY THESE PINS LOOK LIKE THIS (lesson fail_open_plus_monkeypatched_pins_equals_invisible_noop,
earned in this repo hours before this file): a fix shipped today was a pure no-op and every one
of its four pins was green, because every pin MONKEYPATCHED the method under test. Fail-open
plus mocked pins makes a guard's ABSENCE byte-identical to its SILENCE. So:

    Monkeypatched pins prove the POLICY. Only an UNPATCHED pin proves the WIRING.

Every pin below runs the REAL hook file as a REAL subprocess over stdin and asserts the
OBSERVABLE EFFECT in the store. Nothing is patched, stubbed, or imported-and-called. If the
beat is missing, misplaced, swallowed by a bare except, or living in the wrong one of the two
hook copies, these go red.

THE THREE FAILURE PATHS PINNED, each one measured as a live no-op risk before writing:

  W1 WIRING       the hook actually beats. Fails today: nothing beats.
  W2 SCOPE GATE   the beat survives `_in_scope` (claude_posttooluse.py:253). That guard is
                  TARGET-scoped: for a shell tool it returns True only when the command text
                  contains "ai-setup"/"agent_cli.py", or cwd is under the repo. A seat working
                  from C:/Users/L5 on non-repo paths therefore misses it -- and that is exactly
                  the seat that goes DEAD, so the failure is CORRELATED with the thing being
                  measured. The payload here deliberately uses a home cwd and a bare command:
                  if anyone later moves the beat below that gate, this pin goes red.
  W3 TWIN PARITY  BOTH hook copies carry it. scripts/hooks/ and agent/harness/hooks/ are two
                  real files (not symlinks), differing only by sys.path depth. A HOME-rooted
                  session loads ONLY C:/Users/L5/.claude/settings.json, which runs the
                  scripts/ copy -- while check_wiring.py, the project settings, and every
                  convention in the tree point a developer at the agent/ copy. Patching the
                  "authoritative" copy alone is a perfect no-op in precisely the seat profile
                  that reads DEAD.

KNOWN BOUND, stated rather than hidden: the hook process is only spawned for tools named in the
settings matcher (Bash|PowerShell|Edit|Write|NotebookEdit|Task). A turn made purely of Read /
Grep / Glob / mcp__* calls still produces no beat. That gap is real, is NOT closed by this file,
and is not pinned here because no pin over this hook can observe an event the harness never
sends. See the commit message for the follow-on.
