"""Pins for the four defects found in the 2026-08-26 post-OOM audit.

The machine ran out of 62GB overnight and the forensics found no smoking gun, because
nothing was recording process memory. What the audit DID find was four defects, each
verified line by line. These are their pins, written RED before the fixes.

  P1  deepseek tool results append to history with NO clip, while gemini/kimi/sol all
      clip at 20000. Combined with MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS defaulting to 10**9 and a convos
      dict that never evicts, one big read is re-sent every remaining hop and retained
      for the life of the process. The codebase already MEASURED this: 393M tokens over
      309 turns, worst turn 11.4M over 127 hops.

  P2  revive._cmdlines() swallows every exception -- including its own 25s CIM timeout --
      into an empty string, which counts as ZERO gateways to a consumer whose only move
      is to spawn one. The EarWatchdog scheduled task runs it every 5 minutes, so memory
      pressure slows the probe, the timeout reads as death, and the cure is another
      process. Receipts: 4 then 3 concurrent gateways ~50 min before the poweroff.
      THE RULE: an unanswerable probe must REFUSE, never remediate. "I don't know" may
      not be spelled the same as "it's dead". revive.py already states this rule for its
      app rung (a probe that cannot run must read as NOT healthy) -- the process rungs
      just never honoured it.

  P3  remote_relay._write_jsonl uses a FIXED temp filename and accept() does an unlocked
      read-modify-write under a ThreadingHTTPServer with no thread cap. Two concurrent
      admits race os.replace and one message is SILENTLY DROPPED -- on the inbox that is
      also the idempotency ledger.

  P4  ManagedChild turns env=None into {} and hands that to Popen, which means a truly
      empty environment -- no PATH, no SYSTEMROOT, none of the AKASHIC_* overrides.
      subprocess.Popen's own contract is that env=None INHERITS. remote_bridge_supervise
      is the one caller that omits env, and it is the file that exists because the
      listener kept vanishing.
