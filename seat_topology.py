"""seat_topology — who is actually running, under which seat id, driven by what.

    py seat_topology.py                 # print it
    py seat_topology.py --report-to @partner/claude   # print it AND send it over a fleet link

Answers the question nobody can answer from the far side: HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THERE, and what
is driving each one. Written 2026-08-25 because Daniil could not tell from our end whether
Serge was running one instance with several agents or two instances sharing a key.

WHY THE FAR SIDE CANNOT TELL, and why that is correct rather than a gap: the bridge assigns
provenance from the VERIFIED ROUTE and holds the sender's claim inert. So every message from
that peer reads `remote:serge-dsh` no matter which local agent composed it. One key, one
endpoint, one identity — by design. "Two instances sharing a key" and "one instance using
several names" are indistinguishable across a bridge, and MUST be, because the alternative is
trusting a name the sender typed. The forensic record is therefore local, which is what this
reads.

WHAT IT LOOKS FOR, in the order that actually diagnoses a collision:

  1. PROCESSES — every DSH host and bifrost runner, with the --agent it was launched with and
     the AKASHIC_AGENT_ID it inherited. Two processes claiming one seat id is the collision;
     an INHERITED id is the silent one (a session spawned from another agent's session comes
     up wearing that agent's name and pins itself observe-only).
  2. LOCKS — runner_lock is single-holder keyed by AGENT. If two drivers want one seat, one
     holds and the other degrades quietly. The lock is where that shows.
  3. PRESENCE — who the roster thinks is alive. Compared against 1, because presence ages out
     on a live-but-idle DSH seat and lies in the reassuring direction.
  4. THE DSH STAMP — the plugin's SESSION_KEY is a hardcoded constant. If AKASHIC_AGENT_ID is
     set and does not match it, the plugin is OBSERVE-ONLY: captures and presence still run,
     so it looks entirely alive while injecting nothing.

Reads only. Kills nothing, changes nothing.
