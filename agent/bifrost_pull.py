    Grafana Loki (collapse at render, never at ingest); OTel tail-sampling (decide per snapshot,

    W84 (07-28, deepseek): DUAL-WRITE TWIN DEDUP. T039a/T044 dual-write means every message
    exists on TWO streams. Before rendering, near-identical messages (same frm+kind+

    WHOLE window, NOT adjacent-only: `seen_twins` is keyed across the entire list, which is

    original by any number of interleaved messages. The docstring said "adjacent" until a
    claim audit on 2026-08-07 flagged the mismatch; the CODE was right and the word was
    stale. Note the deliberate asymmetry with the TRACE fold above, which IS
    consecutive-only (rsyslog pmlastmsg semantics) -- two different collapse rules in one
    function, and conflating them is exactly how this word went wrong.
    The dedup is RENDER-ONLY
    (lossless -- nothing dropped, nothing consumed) and uses content prefix matching so a
    genuine follow-up with different content is never collapsed. Sha/reply_id dedup is stronger
    but requires envelope access; the prefix heuristic catches the dual-write case (identical

      - consume-THEN-arm (arming on an undrained inbox insta-wakes: failure ledger C1-2);
      - a seat held by a provably-dead session gets rescued inside consume_inbox (C1-1);
      - a seat held by a LIVE twin means the TWIN is the wakeable seat-holder -- listening here

    wraps this and, when the decision is 'listen', BLOCKS as the wake listener's parent -- so one
