"""Claude Code UserPromptSubmit hook -> PLAN-TIME recall (field-survey C3).

Review leverage runs research > plan > code: a lesson injected at PreToolUse arrives AFTER
the plan is committed and can only save the line in front of the agent. This hook surfaces
the corpus BEFORE planning starts, ranked against the user's prompt itself -- the highest
altitude the harness offers per-turn.

Discipline (same rules as every recall surface):
  - top 2 only, relevance-floored, FAITH-gated, silent-when-empty (recall_at does all of it)
  - SHARED anti-repeat with the PreToolUse hook (one seen-file per session): a lesson shown
    at plan time never re-injects at action time, and vice versa
  - logged to the injection ledger with altitude="plan" (inspectable, cost-measured)
  - scope: repo or home-dir sessions only (the SessionStart whisper's tiering) -- unrelated
    projects stay unpolluted
  - fail-OPEN, kill switch AKASHIC_PLAN_RECALL=0

NOTE on crediting: plan-time impressions bump `surfaced` counters but open NO action-target
impression, so they can earn explicit useful/noise votes but never an implicit 'helped'
(there is no target to join a flip against). This DILUTES value rate by design honesty --
the ledger's altitude field keeps per-altitude analysis possible.

Also carried per-turn (H0b): ONE unread-bus line (silent-at-0) -- mid-session bus mail
otherwise waits for the next session's boot whisper; the turn start is its natural read
point. A cue like the whisper, not a lesson push, so it is not ledgered (and
AKASHIC_PLAN_RECALL=0 kills lesson injection only, never the mail cue).

Wire (user-level absolute path; the "*" matcher is REQUIRED -- lifecycle entries without one
may be silently skipped):
