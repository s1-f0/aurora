"""Stop hook: keep THIS Claude session wakeable from idle + audit the turn's ending.

Fires when the turn ends. Two independent, independently-latched checks:

1. WAKE (original): if no bifrost.wake listener (scripts/bifrost_wake.py) is armed for this
   agent, BLOCK the stop and tell the model to re-arm -- turning "always wakeable" from fragile
   discipline into a harness-enforced invariant ("the environment decides" applied to Claude's
   own idling). The listener writes a PID heartbeat; this hook checks that PID is alive.
   Loop-guarded (won't block twice within 25s).

2. PROMISE (first-party fold-in 2026-07-08): if the turn's FINAL paragraph reads as a promise
   of future work ("I'll ...", "Next I'll ...") rather than an outcome, bounce ONCE per session
   with a teaching reason -- the last-paragraph check from the frontier harness, ported to the
   stop boundary we already own. High-precision patterns only; paragraphs that ask the user a
   question, condition on the user ("once you...", "say the word"), or announce a STOP in
   future-tense grammar ("I'll wait for your review") are legitimate endings and never bounced.
   Scoped to Akashic sessions (agent.harness.scope), kill switch AKASHIC_STOP_PROMISE=0.

Ordering + precision contract (made explicit after DeepSeek's 2026-07-08 review): at most ONE
block per stop attempt -- wake precedes promise, so an unarmed session hears about the promise
only on its NEXT stop (self-correcting across turns, never a wedge). And grammar-level matching
has a precision ceiling: past the opener/carve-out lists, false positives and negatives differ
only in INTENT, which a regex cannot see -- the chosen mitigation is the once-per-session latch
bounding any misfire to a single nudge, NOT an ever-growing stopword list.

Both checks fail OPEN (never wedge the session).
