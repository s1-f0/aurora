"""Claude Code PreToolUse hook -> git-safety guard (Concurrency design C0).

Wire it in .claude/settings.json (project-launch, relative path):
  {"hooks":{"PreToolUse":[{"matcher":"Bash|PowerShell","hooks":[
    {"type":"command","command":"py agent/harness/hooks/claude_pretooluse.py"}]}]}}
(PowerShell is the harness's PRIMARY shell tool on Windows -- a Bash-only matcher routes every
shell command around the guard/recall/credit pipeline entirely. Matchers, the tool filter in
main(), and _in_scope must all know a new shell tool, or it is invisible.)
Or register at the USER level with an ABSOLUTE path so it fires for EVERY session launched from
any cwd (the read-bootstrap flow), e.g. command "py E:/AI-Setup/agent/harness/hooks/claude_pretooluse.py".
The scope guard (agent/harness/scope.py -- shared policy, this adapter only maps Claude's tool
names onto it) makes it a silent no-op outside this repo, so global registration is safe.

Reads the tool-call JSON on stdin. If the Bash command blanket-stages git (or a peer holds
an advisory lock on the target path), emit a DENY decision (the reason is fed back to Claude).
Otherwise the action is ALLOWED -- and on the allow path we attach RECALL-AT-ACTION:
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` carrying the few highest-signal active lessons + any
lock/peer warning for this path/command (core/recall/at_action.py). This is the read-at-the-
moment-of-action seam -- the one native injection that lands AT the locus, not at turn-start.
Recall is best-effort, capped, FAITH-gated, and fails OPEN. Disable with AKASHIC_RECALL_AT_ACTION=0.
Fails OPEN on any unexpected error -- a guard must never brick the agent.

Note: exit 0 + a {permissionDecision:"deny"} JSON is the documented block path.
Do NOT signal a policy block with exit code 1 -- Claude Code treats exit 1 as a
non-blocking error and PROCEEDS with the action.

    right -- and was silent 220 minutes later when T227 went into a filename that collided
    with a DONE task. Lessons are indexed by TOPIC, so they land at the trigger site and not
    at the application site. This is the application site.

    FACT, NOT RULE. "MINT THE IDENTIFIER FIRST" is a rule: general, true, context-free, and
    ignorable, because a rule asks something of you. "T227 is DONE: LEXICON gains its MECHANISM
    column" asks nothing at all -- it just closes an information gap, and that is what makes it
    ambient rather than a demand.

    FIRE ON THE ANOMALY, NOT THE ACTION. There are already ~269 injections and ~42k tokens a
    day here, and the corpus's own prior art says reduce volume to increase trust. So precision
    comes from separating MINTING from MENTIONING:
      * a PATH carries a minted id; prose merely references one, and commit bodies name done
        tasks constantly -- those must never fire.
      * a path that already EXISTS is being edited, not minted.
      * an ACTIVE id in a new path is someone working their claim.
    Only a TERMINAL id in a NEW path is the mistake, so this should fire approximately never,
    and its silence carries information too.

    match on a short string. Fails OPEN on everything: a helper that can brick a Write is not
    a helper.
