"""Claude Code PreToolUse hook -> live tool-call trace onto the Bifrost bus.

Claude runs OUTSIDE any Bifrost runner, so (unlike DeepSeek) its tool calls never reach the
console on their own. This hook is the bridge: for every tool call in an in-repo session it
broadcasts a display-only kind=trace line (agent/harness/trace.py), which the UI already renders
with Claude's colour. The result -- Claude "shows up" doing work, at parity with DeepSeek.

Register under PreToolUse with a broad matcher so it covers the shell (Bash AND PowerShell, the
Windows primary), file tools, and the read/search tools that make up most exploration:
  {"hooks":{"PreToolUse":[{"matcher":"Bash|PowerShell|Read|Edit|Write|NotebookEdit|Glob|Grep|Task|WebFetch|WebSearch",
    "hooks":[{"type":"command","command":"py agent/harness/hooks/claude_trace.py"}]}]}}

SEPARATE from claude_pretooluse.py on purpose: that hook is the git/lock GUARD + recall, scoped
to mutating tools and able to DENY. This one only observes -- it emits and always exits 0, never
influencing whether the tool runs. Scope-gated to this repo's sessions (safe for user-level
registration). Fail-open and silent: a trace is a nicety, never a blocker. Kill: AKASHIC_TRACE=0.
