"""The auto-boot whisper shared by every harness adapter (Integration Tiers H0).

T074 Phase 1: the whisper IS the primer (reconciled build spec
docs/library/report/20260715_t074-seamless-continuity-reconciliation_89103c.md; deepseek's contract
governs). A fresh seat must orient from the whisper alone -- no manual pasting.

Sections, in priority order (each independently fail-soft; drop order is bottom-up so
the orienting core survives budget pressure):

  1 DIRECTIVE  what am I doing?        next-focus note, age-stamped ([STALE] >= 7d)
  2 WHERE      where did we leave off? where-we-are note, 2 lines, age + curated flag
  3 SIBLINGS   who else is here?       live_incarnations() -- live, never age-stamped
  4 DELTA      what moved?             delta count (live)
  5 THEMES     what's the vibe?        session-themes note when < 30d old (age-stamped)
  6 MAIL       unread bus messages     (live)
  7 DRAFT      un-promoted last-session draft pointer
  8 FUNNEL     recall-value pulse      (live)
  9 BOOT       the one-hop full-boot command (the primer never replaces the ritual)
  + STORY      spill-only: the latest JOURNEY.md entry -- the values-carrier rides
               along when the budget has room, never at a working section's expense.

Budget: AKASHIC_WHISPER_LINES lines total (default 12, ~800-char spirit via per-line
clamps). Tiering is unchanged from v1: repo/home get the whisper; anywhere else stays
SILENT unless something is genuinely NEW (then one line pointing home). Kill switch:
AKASHIC_AUTOBOOT=0. Full boot stays one hop away and remains the ritual.

Age stamps mark PROVENANCE (curated/auto/unflagged -- the flag beats inference; an
unflagged note claims nothing) and AGE, so a seat can tell a live signal from a note
that may have outlived its truth.

    py agent_cli.py bifrost-sync claude" three times in one session, and running that on

    skips those kinds and the consume door already declines to surface them -- only this

    printed remediation could not clear. That is the W131 pathology in a second organ:
    an alert that is routinely wrong teaches the reader to skip the line, and the habit
    carries into the turn when the number means real mail.

    Reused the SHARED skip set PENDING_SKIP_KINDS but that set drifted from the single
    classification source T081-W4 mandated: it skips steer/note/status (NOT trace --
    sig/work lanes) while MISSING thinking/tool/narration/hint (genuine trace-lane
    display-only noise). The badge therefore both nagged on real coordination (note/
    steer) and ignored real firehose (thinking/tool). Route through
    packet_spec.is_trace_kind -- the ONE predicate the consume door (bifrost_pull)
    and mailbox already share -- so the count cannot disagree with what its own
    remediation would surface. FAILS TOWARD NAGGING, deliberately and opposite to
    T198: unknown kinds are NOT trace (fail toward showing), and a truncated peek
    adds its unseen remainder back, because under-reporting real mail is the worse
    error here while the wake path -- where the worse error is deafness -- is

    THE INCIDENT that produced this, 2026-09-24: the operator sent a Discord message that
    reached nobody. The seat was not down -- it was mid-turn and productive, in session all
    morning. It had no armed watcher, because a watcher is a SEPARATE process and nobody had
    asked for one. The message landed in the mailbox correctly, marked `unhandled`, and nothing
    announced it. Storage was fine; NOTIFICATION was missing. Task T398 has 13 prior
    recurrences of the same shape, all of them assumed to be "no session open" -- this one had
    a session open the whole time, which is why the diagnosis kept missing.

    WHY THIS REPORTS RATHER THAN ARMS, which is the part worth not losing. Arming from a hook
    was the obvious fix and it is a trap: scripts/bifrost_wake.py delivers by PRINTING TO STDOUT
    and exiting, so a wake only lands if something is reading that stream. A watcher spawned
    detached by a hook prints into a void -- and any_armed() would then answer "armed". That is
    a surface asserting presence where there is no reachability, which is strictly worse than
    the silence it replaces, because "no watcher" at least reads as no watcher. The arming has
    to happen on a channel the harness is watching, so boot hands over the command instead of
    running it.
