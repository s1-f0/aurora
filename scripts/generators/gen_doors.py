"""gen_doors -- regenerate docs/DOORS.md: the agent-door I/O reference, derived (master-map M2, v0).

Daniel's ask 2026-07-19 (verbatim slice): "every system where and what its inputs and outputs
are." The CLI is the fleet's biggest door and its argparse tree ALREADY declares every verb and
argument -- so the reference derives from build_parser() itself, never hand-listed, never rots.
v0 covers the CLI door (agent_cli.py). The MCP door (ai_setup_mcp.py) and the runner ToolBox
door are named as KNOWN-GAP sections for the fence (deepseek's map-counter question #3: are the
ToolBox schemas introspectable as built) rather than half-derived here.

Run:  py scripts/generators/gen_doors.py            # writes docs/DOORS.md
      py scripts/generators/gen_doors.py --check    # exit 1 if stale vs code (CI/pre-ship)
