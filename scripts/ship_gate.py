"""ship_gate -- the suite gate as a ONE-WAY RATCHET (T031 unblock, 2026-07-27).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
scripts/ship.py gates on the FULL pytest suite, fail-fast. The tree carries pre-existing
failures, so ship.py ABORTED ALWAYS -- the disciplined door was IMPASSABLE, not merely longer.
Measured consequence: six commits in one night through raw `git commit`, and therefore ZERO runs
of the three T031 method checkers that ride ship.py lines 38-42. The method loop
("awareness at boot -> recall at action -> gates at ship -> scorecard at wrap",
agent_cli.py:1449) is complete and correctly wired, and its enforcement stage was bypassed
because it could not be passed. Nobody forgot the method; the compliant path was blocked.

core/coord/suite_baseline.py already computed the needed delta ({new, fixed, inherited}) and
was never wired to the gate. This module is that wiring, and nothing more.

THE RISK, NAMED AND BOUNDED
---------------------------
Making a red suite shippable is exactly how "blocking" becomes "inherited" and an inherited list
rots into a growing amnesty -- the same shape as the four failures found the same night (a red
pin nobody ran; a stall filed at dashboard tier; a --check wired to nothing; 96% of lessons
unreachable). A computed red routed to a channel nobody acts on.

So this is a RATCHET, not an amnesty, and the ratchet is the whole design:
  * a NEW failure always blocks -- no flag, no override
  * a FIXED failure leaves the baseline AUTOMATICALLY and can never quietly return; if it
    regresses it is NEW, and it blocks. This is the self-limiting property: the list can only
    shrink through ordinary work, and growing it takes deliberate action.
  * inherited failures are ANNOUNCED on every ship. Silence is how a red becomes furniture.
  * a stale baseline announces its own age.
  * NO baseline FAILS CLOSED. Absence of evidence is not amnesty -- that is the confident-zero
    disease in gate form, and suite_baseline.delta() already gets this right by putting
    everything in `new`.
