"""Remote bridge listener — the HTTP door in front of the inbound gate (v1).

Design: docs/library/design/remote-bifrost-bridge-design.md §3.3. Pins:
tests/test_remote_bridge_listener_pins.py (all offline — the handler is a pure function and
the socket server is a thin shell over it).

THIS IS THE DANGEROUS HALF, and the design says so in its own §5: "the entire danger
concentrates at v1. A remote peer that can speak `chat` into our bus can try to talk an agent
into running commands." Everything below is written to keep that sentence false.

THE DIVISION OF LABOUR. core/comm/remote_relay.accept() decides ADMISSION — is this envelope
authentic, fresh, and of a kind we accept. This module decides EXPOSURE — who can reach the
door at all, how much they may make us allocate, and what they learn when refused. Two
questions, and conflating them is how a correct gate ends up behind an open door.

THE ASYMMETRY, because it reads as a violation of house style until you see who the reader is.
This repo's error doctrine is errors-that-teach, and accept() honours it with long, specific
refusals. Those go to the LOG. The WIRE gets one flat refusal, identical for a forged
signature, a stale replay, a control kind and a malformed body — because a distinct message
per failure makes an unauthenticated endpoint an ORACLE. Probe it and you learn whether the
key is wrong, whether it is merely stale, whether the kind you tried exists. Errors-that-teach
is a rule about the reader; across a fleet boundary the reader is not necessarily a friend.

WHAT THIS DOOR DELIBERATELY CANNOT DO:
  - it cannot be reached from outside the machine unless someone TYPED --allow-public
  - it has one verb on one path; everything else is 404/405 with no hint
  - it never puts anything on the live bus (accept() parks; an agent drains deliberately)
  - it never raises, so a malformed byte is not a denial of service
  - it is inert until keyed: started without the inbound key, it refuses everything

    link-local) is reachable only by nodes already admitted to that network — a different and
    far smaller population than "the internet".

    THE WILDCARD IS PUBLIC, NOT PRIVATE. `0.0.0.0` binds every interface at once, including
    any public one, so it is the worst case rather than a neutral one and can never be
    inferred safe from its own digits.

    KNOWN LIMIT, DOCUMENTED RATHER THAN HIDDEN: this reads ranges, and some overlays squat
    ranges that are formally public — Radmin VPN hands out 26.x.x.x, and 26.0.0.0/8 is real
    IANA space. Such an address classifies 'public' and still needs the operator to say
    --allow-public out loud. That is the intended trade: silently trusting an unrecognised
