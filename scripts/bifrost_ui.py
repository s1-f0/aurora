"""
bifrost_ui -- a realtime web console for watching (and steering) live agent collaboration on Bifrost.

A zero-dependency (Python stdlib only) local web server that bridges the Bifrost bus to a polished
browser UI. You see Claude and DeepSeek converse in real time, PAUSE them to interject, type messages
that wake the agents, and DRAG-AND-DROP files to share them into the project (agents can then read them
with their tools). Serves on 127.0.0.1 only -- it is a local cockpit, never exposed.

  py scripts/bifrost_ui.py                 # http://127.0.0.1:8787  (config.PORT_UI)
  py scripts/bifrost_ui.py --port 8901     # a throwaway UI: the 89xx test band, NEVER 8787

Transport: Server-Sent Events (bus -> browser, live) + plain POST (browser -> bus). No websockets, no
build step, no npm. Pause/loop-guard come from core/comm/control.py; messages from core/comm/bus.py.

# ---- VFX bench presets ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A FILE, deliberately, not localStorage. A preset in a browser's storage is invisible to the other
# party -- Daniil could tune something excellent and claude would have no way to read it, and vice
# versa. On disk it is a shared artefact: tune in the browser, read it with any tool, paste it into
# the state table, commit it. That is the whole difference between a shared bench and two private
# ones, and it costs one JSON file.
# ---- VFX sketches -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A sketch is a fragment shader being TRIED. It lives as a plain .frag file rather than inside
# agent-avatar.js, and that separation IS the buffer property: a sketch that does not compile costs
# you the sketch and never the console avatar, because nothing in production ever loads one.
# Promotion into STYLES stays a deliberate edit rather than a side effect of saving.
#
# Files, again, rather than browser storage -- a sketch Daniil pastes is one claude can read and
# improve, and a sketch claude writes shows up in Daniil's dropdown with no handover step.
# ---- VFX chunks + compositions ----------------------------------------------------------------
# A CHUNK is one reusable piece of shader with a declared role, stored as a .glsl file whose first
# line is a //! JSON header. Roles exist because a fragment shader has exactly three places a piece
# can go, and pretending otherwise is what makes shader node editors collapse into spaghetti:
#     helper   -- a top-level function; order-free, deduplicated by name
#     source   -- writes col/alpha; exactly one per composition, it is what you are looking at
#     modifier -- transforms col in place; ORDER MATTERS and that order is the composition
# Anything that does not fit one of the three is not a chunk, it is a new source.
#
# This is the part that remembers HOW rather than WHAT. Presets remember a tuning and sketches
# remember a finished shader; neither can tell you that tanh must come after the superlinear
# highlight, or that the cubic vignette must be normalised by the true corner distance or it
# blacks out the sides of a widescreen. Those facts lived only in commit messages, which is to say
# they were already lost.
# ---- VFX groups -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A GROUP is a named run of modifiers -- "filmic finish" = superlinear-highlight, tanh-tonemap,
# vignette-cubic, triangular-dither. It is the reusable unit that sits between a chunk (one idea)
# and a composition (a whole picture), and it is the one that actually gets reused: nobody reaches
# for a tone curve alone, they reach for the four-step finish that has always worked together.
#
# Stored EXPANDED, as the list of chunk names, not as a reference. A group is a shorthand for a
# sequence, not an indirection: expanding on drop means a composition never depends on a group
# file still existing or still meaning the same thing, and editing a group cannot silently change
# a picture somebody already saved.
# ---- VFX graphs -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A graph is nodes + typed edges. It is stored, not compiled, here -- codegen lives in the browser
# next to the thing that has to run it, so a graph that fails to compile fails where you can see it.
# ---- VFX snapshots ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE MIRROR. claude cannot see rendered output -- every visual judgement this session has been
# made by counting pixels through readPixels, which is why "your eyes are the verification here"
# kept appearing. But claude CAN read an image file. So the bench writes one.
#
# This is the single highest-leverage thing in the whole bench: it turns "I measured 42,120 lit
# pixels and infer it looks right" into "I looked at it". A number can only confirm what you
# already suspected; a picture can surprise you, and being surprised is the entire value of
# looking.
# ---- VFX job queue: claude asks, the open bench renders --------------------------------------
# Every render this session cost 4-5 tool calls -- restart, navigate, inject JS, wait, read back --
# and kept breaking on browser-pane quirks. The fix is not a second renderer in Python: porting the
# shaders would duplicate every one of them into something that drifts. It is to let the bench that
# is ALREADY OPEN do the work, and give claude a client.
#
# One implementation, two callers. The page executes the same thumbShaderFor / renderSheet / snap
# it uses for its own buttons, so a CLI-requested thumbnail cannot disagree with a clicked one.
#
# The honest constraint: a /vfx tab must be open. That is stated in the CLI's error rather than
# left as a hang -- "no renderer attached" is a diagnosis, a timeout is a mystery.

# ---- WHICH TAB IS THE RENDER FARM --------------------------------------------------------------
# Found by reproducing it: open /vfx a second time and that tab ALSO starts polling for jobs, so
# renders split between the two at random depending on which one's timer fires first. That is bad
# in every case and actively broken in the common one -- the second tab is usually a background or
# hidden pane, where the browser throttles rAF and never composites, so the job it wins either
# stalls or captures a frame that was never drawn. The failure has no symptom at the CLI beyond a
# render that took the wrong path or timed out, which sends you debugging the shader.
#
# So the renderer is a LEASE, not a free-for-all: one tab holds it, renews it by polling, and loses
# it after a few seconds of silence so closing the tab hands the farm to whoever is left. A visible
# tab may take the lease from a hidden one, because a hidden holder cannot do the job it is
# holding -- which is the exact case that made this a bug rather than a curiosity.

# ---- WHAT THE BENCH IS CURRENTLY SHOWING -------------------------------------------------------
# Daniil said, "If I refresh the page your buffered demo gets lost."
#
# Exactly so, and it was worse than a nuisance: claude loads a shader into the open bench, Daniil
# reloads for any reason, and the bench boots back to the default avatar with no trace of what was
# on it. The work was not saved anywhere because the bench had no notion of a CURRENT SUBJECT -- it
# only had an AgentAvatar that things were temporarily done to.
#
# So the bench's current subject is state, and it lives HERE rather than in localStorage for two
# reasons: a reload must restore it (either would do that), and claude must be able to READ and SET
# it (only this does). It is a plain JSON file next to the presets, on the same principle as
# everything else in this bench -- either side can read it, edit it and commit it.

        structurally invisible. Tonight's own example: claude and deepseek-ui have been working
        the UI rebuild on namespace `uiwork` for hours, and nothing on this page could show it.

        A namespace is not registered anywhere, so it must be DISCOVERED. Every live seat writes
        `<ns>:worklive:<agent>#<sid8>`, which makes that key family the cheapest honest census --
        a channel exists exactly when somebody is beating in it. Read-only, no cursor touched,
        no consumer seat taken: this must never be able to steal mail from the very seats it
        reports on (the Eye rule -- observe without disturbing any reader).

        Bounded by construction: SCAN with a count cap rather than KEYS, and only worklive keys.

     layer is a REGISTRY of swappable variants persisted per browser, so the thing rendering into
     his header is a component I have never had mounted and therefore cannot name from here.
     Identification kept failing; a constraint cannot. Whatever renders into this row, it lives
     inside a bounded band from now on: children may scroll sideways, never grow the page
     downward. This is the same lesson as .pills nowrap, applied one level up where it holds for
     components that do not exist yet.

     and were unreachable, and at 900px the strip clipped mid-word ("kimi" sliced in half).
     Measured cause: the row overflowed by 399px (scrollWidth 1579 vs 1180) because .pills took
     998px of it with no min-width:0, so #epiChip was crushed from 162px of content into a 22px
     box and everything after it was pushed out of the viewport.
     A flex item's default min-width is auto, so a data strip that grows with the fleet will
     ALWAYS win the row unless told otherwise. It is the same unbounded-by-roster-count disease as
     the roster popover height and the animation budget: size as a function of fleet size, with no

       children are rendered by a swappable REGISTRY['tile'] variant persisted per browser.
       Under the default variant they are 58px chips and everything is fine; under `glass-card`
       they are ~535px cards, and with wrapping allowed 11 of them stack into a ~950px column
       INSIDE THE HEADER ROW -- which is exactly the "ai list taking half the screen" Daniil kept
       reporting while my headless browser, holding the default variant, rendered a tidy strip and
       showed me nothing wrong. Same code, different persisted preference, opposite layout.
       nowrap + a height cap makes the strip behave identically under EVERY variant: it scrolls
       sideways, it never grows downward, and no future tile renderer can reopen this. */
     NOWRAP SURVIVES THE RESIZE HANDLE, and that is the point. Dragging raises the CAP; it never
     licenses wrapping. So the strip still cannot stack into a column no matter how tall it gets
     or which tile variant is persisted -- the disease above stays cured -- while the height
     stops being a number I chose for someone else. The child cap rides the same variable,
     because a taller bar that still clips its cards at 40px would grow empty space and reveal
     nothing, which is the version of this that looks broken. */

     WHY THIS IS THE FIX AND NOT A FEATURE ON TOP OF ONE. #ash-frame is a flex child of #ash
     inside .cwrap inside .composer -- three ancestors negotiating its box. Measured tonight:
     a literal `width:192px !important` on it does nothing, and so did the ORIGINAL code, so
     the pane was never resizable in place by anyone. position:fixed is what takes it out of
     that negotiation; the drag and the magnetism are what make being out of it pleasant.

     DOCKED IS THE DEFAULT AND STAYS THE DEFAULT. Nothing floats until someone pops it out, so
     the console Daniil and Serge already know is untouched until they ask for something else.
     The placeholder holds the dock's shape so popping out does not collapse the row it left. */

  /* GLASS COMPOSER (Daniil: "sucker for glass blur effect and subtle edges with either glow or
     shadow"). Four layers, and each does a different job -- this is what separates real glass
     from a translucent rectangle:
       1 TRANSLUCENT FILL + BACKDROP BLUR -- the aurora behind is visible but abstracted, so the
         box sits IN the scene rather than on top of it.
       2 A BRIGHT TOP EDGE (inset 1px highlight). Physical glass catches light on its upper lip;
         this single inset line is what reads as "thickness" and is the most-skipped detail.
       3 A DROP SHADOW that is mostly BELOW and heavily feathered -- it lifts the box off the
         background without drawing a hard outline.
       4 A FOCUS GLOW rather than a focus border: colour blooms outward on focus-within instead
         of a ring snapping on, which is the modern reading of "subtle edges with glow". */

  /* === RAZER SQUARE selector frame ===
     Daniil 2026-08-01: "the hexagon and agent avatar are supposed to be one button to the left of
     the message field." They were two controls doing one job in two places -- #ash was a standalone
     56px row ABOVE the composer (hexagon -> horizontally expanding tile strip) while the live
     presence avatar sat separately in the composer, and the Broadcast chip was a THIRD way to pick
     a target. Now: #ash lives inside .cwrap as the single left-hand control, the live avatar mounts
     INSIDE the frame (presence-cloud.js pc-inframe), and the tile strip opens as a popover instead
     of expanding inline -- an inline expander in the composer row would squeeze the message field,
     which is the thing it sits next to. */
  /* THE AGENT BUTTON: avatar + name + status, as one labelled control.
     Daniil: "fix our agent selection button to not have that C be misplaced. thats supposed to be
     our avatar, I want it to have useful information on hover and to actually have the name of
     the ai underneath it as well as other cool status info."
     The C looked misplaced because TWO things shared one box: the frame's own centred glyph and
     #pcloud absolutely positioned over it. Now the frame is a pure container -- the glyph only
     renders when no avatar is present -- and the name/status sit UNDER it in a column, which is
     also what makes it identifiable at a glance instead of being an unlabelled square. */
