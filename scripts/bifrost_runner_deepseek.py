"""
bifrost_runner_deepseek -- make DeepSeek (a stateless API model) a FIRST-CLASS Bifrost citizen.

Mirrors scripts/bifrost_runner.py (the Gemini runner). DeepSeek has no process and no inbox of its
own, so this runner is its body: it registers @deepseek presence (an Agent Card), blocks on
DeepSeek's Bifrost inbox, and for each incoming ask posts a reply back on the bus. So
`py agent_cli.py bifrost-send <you> --to deepseek "..."` -- or any agent messaging 'deepseek' --
gets a real reply, and the sender wakes (bifrost_wake) when it lands = real-time Claude <-> DeepSeek.

Two modes:
  * one-shot bridge (default) -- each message -> one DeepSeek completion -> reply. Fast, stateless.
  * --agentic -- DeepSeek gets TOOLS (read files, search, git, query the Akashic knowledge base) and
    can chain them WHILE composing the reply, with a per-peer conversation for continuity. Reuses the
    guarded Agent+ToolBox from deepseek_chat.py (read-only, secret-blocked, path-scoped). This is how
    DeepSeek actually investigates the codebase and helps build, not just chat.

  py scripts/bifrost_runner_deepseek.py                     # one-shot, v4-pro, thinking off
  py scripts/bifrost_runner_deepseek.py --agentic           # tool-using peer (reads code/KB live)
  py scripts/bifrost_runner_deepseek.py --agentic --think   # + deep reasoning
  py scripts/bifrost_runner_deepseek.py --model deepseek-v4-flash --once   # cheap; one msg then exit

Key: env DEEPSEEK_API_KEY else .secrets/deepseek.key (reused from ask_deepseek.py). OpenAI-compatible.

# here, 1,240 lines below the originals at 146-153. Both ran at import and this one
# won, harmless only because it re-assigned the same empty values -- and primed to
# silently discard any real initial value the first block ever gains. Removed rather
# than annotated; the canonical definitions are at the top of the module. Pinned by
# tests/test_t110_runner_globals_defined_once.py so it cannot grow back here or in
# the kimi/sol runners.
