"""Discord inbound gateway shell — a thin discord.py loop around core/comm/discord_inbound.py.

Runner family member (wait -> bridge -> reply), auto-enumerated as a wiring entry
point by the bifrost_runner_* rule. Everything decidable lives in the core module
where the pins are; this file owns exactly three things the pins must never touch:
the TOKEN, the SOCKET, and the event loop.

Gateway-side half of the echo-guard: webhook and bot authors are skipped before the
core logic ever sees them — the feed's own posts arrive on this socket too, and a
fleet that hears itself narrate is one bad conditional from a conversation with
itself at 100k messages a second (the tin droplets at least make light).

Run:  py scripts/bifrost_runner_discord.py            (refuses loudly if unconfigured)

    its armed wake listener ARE the wake" -- which holds only if a listener is in fact armed.

    got silence indistinguishable from being ignored. Presence and reachability were two
    questions under one name.

    THE FAIL-OPEN NARROWED, and the old justification is quoted so the change is arguable

    duplicate paid seat per message." True while a cold seat auto-SPAWNED a headless claude.

    cost is gone, while the other side of the trade turned out to be five days of lost mail.
