"""
mirror.py -- the PUBLISH door: commit named paths and push them to the PUBLIC GitHub repo.

It is not a utility. It does not count, read, diff or inspect anything. Its origin is the
public repo balanced7/akashic-aurora (Apache-2.0), and a push cannot be taken back: once a
commit is on GitHub it is published.

    py scripts/mirror.py "msg" path [path ...]               # DRY RUN: help + the plan, changes nothing
    py scripts/mirror.py "msg" path [path ...] --dry-run     # the plan only
    py scripts/mirror.py "msg" path [path ...] --commit      # stage + commit those paths locally, no push
    py scripts/mirror.py "msg" --commit                      # commit only what is already STAGED
    py scripts/mirror.py "msg" --all --commit                # sweep the WHOLE tree (opt-in)
    py scripts/mirror.py "msg" path [path ...] --push --yes  # commit those paths, then publish
    py scripts/mirror.py --push --yes                        # publish the unpushed commits only

Nothing happens without an intent flag. --commit commits locally and never pushes. --push
publishes, and needs --yes; at a terminal you may instead type the branch name when asked.
Without a terminal and without --yes, --push is refused before anything is staged. Before
it pushes, mirror prints every commit that would be published, and it refuses when any of
them was authored by someone other than the invoking seat unless --include-others is given.
It pushes the exact commit it listed, so a commit landing mid-prompt is not carried along.

WHO MAY RUN IT: Daniel at his own terminal (no AKASHIC_AGENT_ID) and the claude seat. Any
other seat, and any process inside the unattended toolbox door (AKASHIC_SEAT_DOOR=toolbox),
is refused before git is touched. Other seats hand their paths and message to Vandor.

WHY (2026-09-15, commit 97b85ecd): the deepseek seat ran `py scripts/mirror.py
"count-plus-lines" <path>` believing it counted a file's lines. Positional arguments alone
committed a stale .patch file as "count-plus-lines" and pushed it, and the push also
published every unpushed commit since 2026-09-13. Seats' own git verbs are refused under
unattended exec; this script ran git for them. Earlier, `mirror.py --help` committed the
shared index the same way (2026-08-02). These are guards against ACCIDENTS: a determined
process can still call git itself.

Two agents share this working tree, so mirror does NOT blanket-stage by default --
that bundles the other agent's unreviewed work into your commit (the FM1 failure,
2026-06-28; see docs/library/design/20260709_concurrent-agents-reinforcing-two-peers_5f6723.md). Name the paths that are yours, or stage
them first with `git add <path>`. `--all` is the explicit opt-in to stage everything
(it prints the full file list first).

This mirrors the CODE/architecture. Knowledge DATA is not in git -- snapshot it
separately:  py scripts/ops/snapshot_knowledge.py snapshot

Exit codes: 0 done (or --dry-run) | 1 git, guard or push failure | 2 nothing to do, usage,
or the no-flag dry run | 3 refused: not Daniel or the claude seat | 4 refused: the push
would publish other authors' commits | 5 refused: the push was not confirmed
