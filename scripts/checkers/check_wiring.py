"""check_wiring -- the Built != Wired gate (membrane slice 2).

A capability that exists + passes tests but is not reachable on any PRODUCTION call path runs nowhere;
latent capability accumulates silently and is a maintainability tax (PRINCIPLES #4, applied to dead
weight). This flags every `core/` module NOT reachable, via the import graph, from a production entry
point (the doors, runners, hooks, boot). Ratchets like the other guards: freeze today's known-standalone
modules in EXCEPTIONS, FAIL on a NEW unwired module.

Limitation: static imports only (incl. lazy imports inside functions). A module reached solely via a
computed importlib name won't be seen; add it to EXCEPTIONS with a note if so.

Run:  py scripts/checkers/check_wiring.py            # gate (exit 1 on a NEW unwired core/ module)

    They declare their own runnability instead, and this reads that declaration. Without it
    the entire class is permanently reported unwired, which is worse than noise: the gate's
    only offered remedy is EXCEPTIONS, so each false positive pushes a live tool onto a list
    the file itself calls "a BACKLOG, not an amnesty".

    A LIBRARY IS NOT A TOOL (T134b, 2026-08-03). Reading the `__main__` guard alone also absolved
    any library carrying a demo stub. Measured: core/state/session_recovery.py has no importer and
    no shell caller, its whole guard body is `recovery = main()`, its docstring's usage is `from
    core.state.session_recovery import SessionRecovery`, and core/state/__init__.py re-exports it.
    Nothing about the module changed -- this rule landed and silently reclassified it as wired,
    and the resulting stale-EXCEPTIONS warning invited deleting a still-accurate entry.

    That failure runs the opposite way to the one above and is worse for it: a false positive is
    LOUD and gets argued with, while a gate that quietly stops asking just gets believed. So
    re-exported modules keep their unwired verdict; the three modules this rule was written for
    (durable_reconcile, migrate_to_sqlite, pack_replay) are re-exported by nothing and are
    unaffected.

#
# The module gate above passed every day while core/comm/mailbox.py::declare_intent had zero
# production callers: mailbox.py IS imported by the CLI door, so the MODULE read wired while the
# capability inside it was dead. Git holds the diagnosis in a human's handwriting -- c91ca73 built
# declare_intent with 8/8 pins, and e438ccd wired it with the message "built was not wired -- no
# door exposed the M1 verbs". This is that sentence, automated.
#
# EVIDENCE IS DELIBERATELY WEAK, and that is the design. "Referenced" means MENTIONED BY NAME on a
# production path -- call, attribute, bare name, import alias, keyword argument, or an exact-match
# string constant (getattr and verb-table dispatch). The comments above record the same lesson
# twice (control_channel.py, door_probe.py): a false positive here is expensive twice over, because
# the only remedy this file offers is an EXCEPTIONS entry, and a guard that cries wolf gets fed
# exceptions until it guards nothing. So this reports only capability with ZERO mentions -- the
# class it can be certain about -- and stays quiet everywhere else.
#
# Limitations, stated rather than discovered later: an unused import counts as wiring (an unused
# import is a different defect, and calling it deadness would produce false positives); a name
# assembled at runtime ("declare_" + verb) is invisible; a private helper reached only through a
# dead public function is not reported, because the public function is what gets reported first.

# T144: marks a reference that came from a STRING CONSTANT rather than a name/attr/alias.
# Tagged rather than dropped, because string evidence is still real -- getattr dispatch -- but only
# when it crosses a module boundary. Plain ASCII on purpose: a sentinel that cannot appear in a
# Python identifier, and cannot corrupt the source the way a control character would.
