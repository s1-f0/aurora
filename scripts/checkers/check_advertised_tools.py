"""check_advertised_tools -- the tool-surface twin of check_advertised_verbs (T142).

check_advertised_verbs enforces the SHELL half of the door contract: every `py agent_cli.py <verb>`
named in live code must resolve. This enforces the TOOL half: every tool a doc tells an agent to
CALL must exist on one of the two tool surfaces -- the DeepSeek ToolBox (core/comm/toolbox.py) or
the MCP server (ai_setup_mcp.py). A name that resolves at either door is advertised truthfully.

WHY IT EXISTS. A read-only seat walked AGENTS.md on 2026-08-03 and could not complete step one. The
contract's first instruction is `py agent_cli.py boot <id>`; `run_command` is gated by allow_exec
plus the ACL families door, and security/acl.json quarantines unlisted agents to read-only BY
DEFAULT -- so the default new agent has no shell. The tool it needed (knowledge_boot) had existed
for months, and AGENTS.md never mentioned the tool surface at all. check_wiring hunts capability
with no door; this hunts a door with no capability behind it.

NAMESPACE-SCOPED BY DESIGN. Only a prefix carrying TWO OR MORE real tools counts as a tool
namespace. `read_`, `write_`, `list_`, `run_` each have exactly one tool and are ordinary
vocabulary in this repo -- write_tombstone, read_verdict, list_parked and list_snapshots are core
functions, not tools. Flagging those would be the false-positive flood that gets a guard fed
exceptions until it guards nothing, which is the lesson check_wiring's own comments record twice.

Run:  py scripts/checkers/check_advertised_tools.py           # gate over the contract docs
      py scripts/checkers/check_advertised_tools.py --report  # also print the tool namespaces
