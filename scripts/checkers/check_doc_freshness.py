"""Doc-freshness guardrail -- the repo ROOT holds only living, intentionally-maintained docs.

Semantic Relationship: Guardrails enforce GeneratedTruthOverHandwrittenStatus

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Pre-rename caps-docs (AGENT_ONBOARDING, SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE, SIGNAL_REFERENCE, ERROR_HANDLING_GUIDE,
...) and hand-written STATUS snapshots drift the moment code moves and quietly mislead the next agent
-- the exact problem the narrative spine replaces. Truth is generated:
    py agent_cli.py status      # live system + lesson/blocker counts
    py agent_cli.py story       # the narrative Atlas (chronicled from Beats + git)
    git log                     # the commit ground-truth
    docs/ROADMAP.md             # the living plan

POLICY (ALLOWLIST, not blocklist -- review DOC-02)
-------------------------------------------------
The old version only flagged STATUS/INVENTORY/CHECKPOINT-shaped *names*, so misleading docs that
didn't match those patterns (AGENT_ONBOARDING.md, SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md, ...) passed clean. Now:
  FAIL (exit 1) if any root-level *.md is NOT in the small allowlist of permitted living root docs.
New design/plan docs belong in docs/; retired docs belong in _archive/. The root stays minimal.

Run: py scripts/checkers/check_doc_freshness.py        (exit 0 = clean root, 1 = an unlisted root doc)
