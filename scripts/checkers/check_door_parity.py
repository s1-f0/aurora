"""check_door_parity -- guard the agent-facing DOOR surface against silent fragmentation.

The agent surface is spread over FOUR doors: the CLI (agent_cli.py), the MCP server
(ai_setup_mcp.py), the runner ToolBox (deepseek_chat.py -- the third door, ENFORCED since
T067-1: `knowledge_map` was declared shared, the guard checked CLI+MCP, declared PASS, and
the one agent who needed it never got the tool), and the low-level bus API
(core/comm/bifrost_api.py). They drift silently -- a verb added to one, forgotten on the
others -- and that is the single biggest source of agent cognitive load (you must know
WHICH door holds each capability). Membrane rule: make the surface EXPLICIT and RATCHET it.

This does NOT unify everything now. It:
  * classifies EVERY CLI/MCP/ToolBox verb in the MANIFEST below
    (shared / cli_only / mcp_only / toolbox_only / gap),
  * FAILS on a NEW unclassified verb on ANY enforced door (stops new drift),
  * FAILS on a `shared` verb missing from CLI or MCP (regression),
  * FAILS on a `shared` verb with NO ToolBox coverage: present by name, covered by a
    declared alias (the ToolBox spells some shared verbs its own way: recall ->
    knowledge_recall), or explicitly EXEMPTED with a rationale (the ToolBox is agentic-tool
    primitives, not a CLI mirror -- design non-goal (g)). A new shared verb with none of
    the three is exactly the knowledge_map class, and it fails loud,
  * notes (never fails) cli_only/mcp_only verbs that ALSO live on the ToolBox -- the
    classification describes CLI<->MCP parity, not ToolBox access (agent self-service),
  * reports `gap`s = the known CLI<->MCP debt to pay down in later slices (does NOT fail).

The bus API is a separate programmatic door (a different abstraction level, not a verb
surface); it is REPORTED for visibility but not parity-enforced.
