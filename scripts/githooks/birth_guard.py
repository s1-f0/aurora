"""Rule-13 birth guard (A1, T101) -- naked .md creation becomes unrepresentable at commit.

Spec: docs/library/design/20260701_artifact-substrate-the-reconciled-design_8ea728.md section 4 + docs/taxonomy-ergonomics-
reconciliation-2026-07.md. Genus: rule-8 mojibake guard (mirror.py pre-commit REFUSE);
the wrap census + audit library domain are the permanent backstops.

Posture (strangler-safe, per the reconciliation's migration window):
  ALLOW   docs/library/** (the door's own projections) · any README.md (generated) ·
          docs/UPPERCASE.md (crown/generated dress, LIBRARY law) · docs/_archive/**.
  REFUSE  any other NEW .md under docs/ -- knowledge is born through the door now:
          py agent_cli.py doc new (or --draft to dump-and-go).
  WARN    new .md under research/ or chronicles/ -- legal during the migration window
          (the corpus still lives there until A3/P3); flips to REFUSE at P3, or now
          with AKASHIC_BIRTH_GUARD=strict.
Env: AKASHIC_BIRTH_GUARD = off (skip, loud) | strict (WARN tier refuses too).
