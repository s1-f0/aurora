"""
deepseek_chat -- an interactive, TOOL-USING conversation with DeepSeek, in its own window.

This is not a chat wrapper: DeepSeek gets a real agentic loop. It can read your files, list and
search the tree, inspect git history, and query Akashic Aurora's own knowledge base -- then chain
those calls (read -> search -> read -> synthesize) with no paste-back, exactly like a code agent.
It holds the full conversation, so you can follow up and it remembers the thread.

  py scripts/deepseek_chat.py                        # agentic, deepseek-v4-pro, thinking on
  py scripts/deepseek_chat.py --allow-exec           # also let DeepSeek run shell cmds (per-call y/N)
  py scripts/deepseek_chat.py --trust                # full autonomy: shell/exec auto-approved
  py scripts/deepseek_chat.py --root E:\\AI-Setup --no-think

Key: env DEEPSEEK_API_KEY, else the gitignored .secrets/deepseek.key. OpenAI-compatible API, so this
uses the `openai` client pointed at api.deepseek.com. deepseek-v4-pro = smartest (1M context).

TOOLS exposed to DeepSeek (read-only ones run automatically; the loop chains them): the runner
ToolBox, core/comm/toolbox.py (~48 tools: files, git, knowledge_*, run_command(gated), web, ...).
Its _fn registrations are the list; this docstring no longer copies it, because copies drift.

SAFETY (a remote model is driving your machine -- guards live in this harness, not in the prompt):
  * File access is scoped to --root (default: this repo). Paths outside it are refused.
  * Secrets are ALWAYS blocked: .secrets/, *.key/*.pem/*.crt, .env, id_rsa, credentials
    (override only with --allow-secrets, which you should almost never do).
  * run_command is OFF unless --allow-exec; then each command needs your [y/N] -- unless --trust.
  * Everything is capped (file bytes, match counts, tool rounds) to bound tokens/cost.

In-chat commands:
  /exit /quit        end          /reset            clear thread (keep system prompt)
  /system <text>     set system   /think [on|off]   toggle reasoning display
  /model <name>      v4-pro|v4-flash                /tools [on|off]   toggle tool use
  /trust [on|off]    auto-approve shell/exec        /exec [on|off]    enable/disable run_command
  /root [<path>]     show/set file-access root      /temp <float>     sampling temperature
  /max <int>         max output tokens              /json [on|off]    JSON response mode (tools off)
  /paste             multi-line input (end: /end)   /save|/load <p>   persist the conversation
  /tokens            usage this session             /help             this list

NOTE: everything (files, command output, KB results) is sent to DeepSeek's API. Don't widen --root or
--allow-secrets over anything you would not share with DeepSeek.
