ai_setup_mcp.py -- the MCP-transport door into the Akashic Aurora (System 5).

This is the MCP twin of ``agent_cli.py``. It exposes the SAME verbs
(boot / learn / recall / status / log / story / events / handoff) as MCP tools,
and it implements them by calling ``agent_cli``'s own ``cmd_*`` functions under a
stdout capture. That is deliberate: there is ONE source of truth for what each verb
does (the CLI), and two doors onto it -- the shell (OpenCode and humans) and MCP
(Cursor / Claude Desktop). They can never drift, because the MCP tool literally runs
the CLI's code path.

Why this replaces the old archived ai_setup_mcp.py: the previous server wrapped the
pre-refactor session pipeline (session_canonical / session_supervisor / fast_cache),
which the Store/Ledger + Context + ACI refactor retired. This server wraps the CURRENT
architecture instead, via the supported entry point (agent_cli / core).

Transport: stdio by default (no port, no manual start -- Cursor/Claude spawn it).

    py -3 ai_setup_mcp.py              # stdio (default)
    py -3 ai_setup_mcp.py --http --port 18765   # optional shared HTTP process

Cursor MCP config key (see mcp_global/cursor.mcp.json): ``akashic-aurora`` — not the
legacy ``breakthrough-stack`` name.

Cross-agent continuity: every write verb (learn / log / handoff) persists through the
shared Store/Ledger on the canonical Redis (config.py: localhost:16379), so a lesson
or handoff one agent records is surfaced by the NEXT agent's `boot` -- regardless of
which door (CLI or MCP) either agent used.

CONCURRENCY (O1, 2026-07-23 -- reconciled spec:
docs/library/report/20260723_reconciliation-mcp-door-concurrency-leve_600574.md):
The SDK session layer handles requests concurrently (task per message) but FastMCP
runs sync tools INLINE on the event loop -- so every verb used to starve the loop
(no pings, no cancellation, batches serialized behind their slowest member; the
parallel-batch wedge, chased since 2026-07-16). The door now dispatches:
  P-1  every tool is async and awaits its sync body on a WORKER THREAD
       (anyio.to_thread) -- the loop stays live for pings/cancellation/other calls;
  P-2  stdout capture is a swap-once THREAD-LOCAL proxy installed at import --
       concurrent captures cannot interleave BY CONSTRUCTION, and any stray write
       from an unarmed thread routes to STDERR, never the JSON-RPC channel;
  P-3  tiered concurrency: READ verbs run concurrently; WRITE verbs + consuming
       reads (consume=true advances cursors -- deepseek C1) + all bus sends
       (ordering semantics -- deepseek C2) serialize under ONE lock;
  P-4  gemini_web_login's Popen gets DEVNULL stdio (a child must never inherit the
       protocol pipes).
Fence: tests/test_mcp_concurrent_calls.py (C1 integrity at concurrency, C2 fast-not-
starved, C3 ping-under-load). The membrane stands: this door is for SEAT-MODEL agents;
runners keep the CLI/bus door and their single-consumer drain loops.

    C7-4 physics: this process owns the JSON-RPC transport on fd 0. A child that
    inherits that handle makes Windows' Proactor defer the pending stdout completion
    until the next inbound frame arrives -- so the tool's work runs to completion and
    the reply never returns. The seat hangs on boot; any later frame flushes it in
    <0.07s. It cost a session on 2026-07-16 and was point-fixed on 2026-07-17 by
    severing stdin in agent_cli's `_git` helper.

    That point fix held for nine days. On 2026-07-25 `_head_commit_epoch` landed on the
    boot path without the sever and the hang came straight back (caught 2026-07-26 by
    the P6 pin, which was red). The lesson is that "remember to pass stdin=DEVNULL" is a
    HOPE, not a guard -- the same shape as the `_ARG_DEFAULTS` keep-in-sync comment that
    the parity pin replaced. An audit found 17 more unsevered spawns in MCP-reachable
    modules; each is one refactor away from being on a verb's path.

    So the invariant is enforced where it actually lives: not at 17 call sites, but at
    the ONE process that owns the handle. This also covers spawns inside third-party
    libraries, which no call-site discipline could ever reach. A caller that genuinely
    wants stdin passes it explicitly -- and `subprocess.run(input=...)` sets stdin=PIPE
    itself, so piped input (scripts/gemini_web.py et al) is untouched. DEVNULL gives a
    child an immediate EOF, which is strictly safer than a read on an inherited pipe.

    Deliberately NOT applied process-wide in agent_cli: a CLI child inheriting the
    terminal is correct there. This is door physics, and it belongs to the door.
